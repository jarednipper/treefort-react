She empowers her students by weaving yogic traditions, stories, and myths with dynamic movement and alignment on the mat and opens  the narrative between body, breath, and mind through authentic expression.\r\n\r\nKimberly believes in the deep power of storytelling. It’s the reason myths are passed down in all traditions and cultures. The telling of a story can bring us into alignment with inspiration, spark creativity, give insight into life’s challenges, touch the heart, and commission the soul. \r\n\r\nBeing affected by Scoliosis in her early 20’s, Kimberly’s curved spine caused her great pain. In the early 1990s, Kimberly began her yoga journey. She learned that through a consistent practice, her scoliosis could be healed and painful knee injuries are now strengthened and stable. \r\nKimberly received her 500 hr RYT through Shanti Yoga Teacher Training and believes that the key is to stay flexible in body, mind and spirit. She teaches the wisdom of Joseph Campbell, “the privilege of a lifetime is to be who you are.”\r\n\r\nShe leads group classes at Yoga Tree of Boise, Sage Yoga & Wellness and the Treasure Valley West Y. She also incorporates wellness programs for the State of Idaho employees. Kimberly believes a good teacher never stops being a student. The list of teachers that inspire her is long and she is full of gratitude towards each including  Dharma Mittra, Shiva Rea, Sianna Sherman, Jason Crandell, Leslie Kaminoff, Debbi Murphy, Max Strom, and Erich Schiffmann.\r\n\r\nEverything is connected;  when we open to the practice of yoga on the mat, not only do our physical bodies become stronger and more supple but our minds become flexible, our hearts grow in empathic compassion, our creativity inspired and the remembrance that we are beings of light.\r\n\r\nWorkshop:\r\nThursday, 2-3 PM\r\nYoga Mythology: A Journey to the Self\r\nA Journey to the Self through movement, breath, and the power of myth.\r\n",

Relentless participation in numerous musical projects bridged genres and created inroads between scenes. Near constant activity quickly made him a locus of gravity in the community. Constant participation quickly opened channels to a broad cross-section of the arts world. Nnamdi has toured the USA, Mexico Europe and Canada with projects ranging from punk to jazz. A full accounting of his musical activity over the last eight years includes approximately 15 bands and dozens of tours. All the while, Nnamdi has not only released a stream of records and EPs under his name and the ironic moniker “Nnamdi’s Sooper Dooper Secret Side Project”, but also runs his own label called SOOPER Records. His solo styling combines hip-hop, experimental rock, gospel, and jazz. His songs can often contain a sense of satire that is just as humorous as it is critical. Nnamdi’s lyrical insights draw on the diversity of his cultural experience as a Black, Jewish, first generation Nigerian-American. His work is characterized by the coupling of sophisticated compositional structures with pop-music motifs.",

The Fact or Faked team investigated videos and photos of alleged paranormal events to determine if they had a natural explanation, were hoaxed, or if they remained unexplained.  In addition to responding to UFO cases, the six person team also led audiences around the world in search of ghosts, Bigfoot, chupacabras, mermaids, and other unusual occurrences.  More recently, Hansen has appeared on \"Expedition Unknown\" and \"Mysteries of the Outdoors\" on the Travel Channel and \"Paranormal Lockdown and \"Ghosts of Shepherdstown\" on Destination America.  \r\n\r\nHansen graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Sociology and Criminology.  He then went to work for several years investigating child physical abuse and sex crimes before moving on to employment in federal law enforcement.  He now uses the skills he learned in interviewing and investigation methodology to focus his research on techniques to validate UFO and other paranormal witness testimony and filter out hoaxers and cases with natural explanations.  As a night vision and thermal imaging equipment dealer, Hansen also works with technology manufacturers to improve low-light video recording with the goal of improving the documentation of the supernatural phenomenon.  His company, Night Vision Ops, can be found online at www.nightvisionops.com.",

        "bio": "Red Light Challenge is a pop rock band made up of two high-energy, multi-instrumental brothers from Hawaii. Brothers Sean (25) and Kyle (20) Luster were born and raised on the island of Oahu, both graduated as valedictorian of their class, and have been playing music together for fun since they were kids. Although the band typically consists of two core members, they continue to create huge soundscapes both live and in the studio using their love for songwriting and their high-energy attitudes. The brothers have developed a unique sound coming from Hawaii, while being able to incorporate catchy Pop melodies, multi-part harmonies, R&B grooves, and Rock sensibilities into their music. \r\n \r\nThe brothers from Red Light Challenge pride themselves on consistently delivering memorable live shows with songs the audience members can move to. Both their electric and acoustic set lists always contain dozens of original songs and a wide range of original takes on cover songs by artists such as The Beatles, Imagine Dragons, Bruno Mars, and many more. In addition to performing and recording, the band created and put on multiple events for “Red Light Challenge, Green Light Go”, a fun, student-interactive assembly program that empowers students to achieve their goals.\r\n \r\nTo expand beyond their Hawaii roots, the band self-booked a national tour performing at Six Flags Amusement Parks and major shopping malls in 2010. They threw out hundreds of Hawaiian leis and “Live Aloha” buttons, spreading Aloha at each stop. The brothers continued performing and writing music after this tour as Sean finished his undergraduate degree in 2013. After Sean graduated, the band self-booked a massive 42-show, 16-state Summer Tour spanning from Colorado to New England and back home to Hawaii.\r\n \r\nIn November of 2014, Red Light Challenge made history by being the first band from Hawaii to earn a Los Angeles Music Award, which took place at The Avalon Hollywood. There, they were presented the prestigious ‘Hot Adult Contemporary Artist of the Year’ award. While in Los Angeles, the band had the opportunity to meet Producer/Engineer Warren Huart (Aerosmith, The Fray, James Blunt, etc.), who wound up producing the band’s debut EP, “Lookout Mountain”, released in 2015.\r\n \r\nAfter moving to Idaho in the summer of 2015 for Kyle to work toward his undergraduate degree and for Sean to attain his Masters, Red Light Challenge has organically grown a large fanbase in the city of Boise. The band has performed over 250 times since moving to Idaho in the summer of 2015. Additionally, in June of 2017, the brothers put a full 5-piece band together to start performing for larger events for bigger audiences. The band has already performed for Downtown Boise’s Alive After Five, Art in the Park, and at the Knitting Factory in Boise. Now, having rhythm guitar, drums, lead guitar, bass, keyboard, and multi-part harmonies in their arsenal, Red Light Challenge has plans to continue performing across the Pacific Northwest and record new music for radio and television throughout 2018.",

She’s the founder of the feminist punk collective, Pussy Riot, and has a history of political activism both in and out of the group. In Moscow in 2011, Pussy Riot began staging unauthorized provocative guerrilla performances in public locations, later editing footage of the performances into music videos, promoting gender equality, LGBT rights, and opposition to Russian President, Vladimir Putin. In 2012, she was convicted of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” after being arrested during a performance in Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. According to Vladimir Putin, the work “undermined the moral foundations of the Russian nation,\" sentencing Nadya and two others to two years’ hard labor in Siberia. She was recognized by the Russian human rights group “Union of Solidarity with Political Prisoners,” named a “prisoner of conscience due to the severity of the response of the Russian authorities” by Amnesty International, and received the LennonOno Grant for Peace in 2012. Her first collaboration with Dave Sitek (TV on the Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Kelis), “Chaika,” was released in February 2016, and her debut EP, “xxx”, came out on October 28.",

Netson joined Mark Lanegan’s touring band through 2005, hitting Europe and the US West Coast once or twice a year. Netson has also appeared on a few of Lanegan’s albums and EPs, as well as albums from Mike Johnson and the Evildoers, Helvetia, the Delusions and others. More recently, Netson appeared as a second guitarist on Earth’s critically acclaimed  album, Primitive and Deadly, and Nate Hall’s (USX) solo release, Electric Vacuum Roar and on the soon to be released Drought Stick by Gridfailure and Earth, Live at Third Man Records.\r\n\r\n  Displaying a wilder, darker, more hedonistic sound than Built To Spill, Caustic Resin released six metal, space rock and psychedelia influenced albums between 1993 and 2003. Among them, 1998's The Medicine Is All Gone, has been described as, “the best record to come down off acid to…” a hallucinogenic, heavy guitar album almost without equal, has been reissued on Netson's own Scavenger Cult records.\r\n\r\n With the latest incarnation of the Netsonian under world exploration, he has scaled it down with the recent acquisition of the Moog Taurus bass synth pedal unit. Massive bass waves and stereo guitar, enabling a nimble path of navigation through the collective unconcious. The newest analog effort The SNAKES/CROSSS split will see release on LP and cassette through Scavenger Cult on October 6th.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Links: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=mbLSPWaf-JY\r\n                   https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=4VwHmtg74Gg\r\nPress Links:  http://www.earsplitcompound.co m/site/2017/06/13/snakes-cross s-split-lp-to-see-release-via- brett-netsons-scavenger-cult-l abel/\r\n                    http://cityworldnews.com/guita rist-brett-netson-lsd-intervie w/",

Dorothy Alice is the full-length follow-up to his EP “Worth It,” named one of 2017’s Best Colorado Albums by Colorado Public Radio’s Open Air. Emerson began writing the album when he found himself down and out in LA; his band had broken up, his relationship was falling apart, and he was sleeping in his car.  When he received the news that a dear loved one had passed away, he knew it was time for a drastic move.\r\n\r\n\tEmerson packed up and moved back to Colorado, where he found his footing and completed the album full of swift fingerpicking, tell-all lyrics, the slickness of LA and the earnestness of Colorado. Emerson’s music has been compared to the likes of Big Thief, Elliot Smith, and Andy Shauf. The live band features members of Paper Bird, Plum, Shady Elders, and Bad Licks. He and his band has shared the stage with the likes of Charles Bradley, Twin Peaks, The Districts, Will Butler (of Arcade Fire), Jeff the Brotherhood, La Luz, and many more.",

Martinsen's classic, soulful vocal style was an immediate click with Wallace's super-sized overdriven soundscapes.\r\n\r\nFuzz-forward guitar, big reverby vocals.

The numbers of self-identified “spiritual but not religious” are rapidly increasing and traditional institutional religion finds itself at a potential turning point. As spiritual seekers are taking the lead in shaping a new faith in America, join a diverse panel of seekers, religiously faithful, and those in between as they explore questions like, Are religion and spirituality the same? Can you be spiritual but not religious? Is spirituality the new religion and what can traditional religious institutions learn from sustained engagement with spiritual seekers?\r\n\r\nThe Spirit Dome Friday - Sunday: The Spirit Dome celebrates the musical traditions of the mutli-faith groups represented in the Boise Spirit Community. We offer 40 minute musical offerings on the hour from 10 am to 6 pm.",

        "bio": "‘Organic electronic’ is the term that Texas native, Hector Carlos Ramirez, uses to describe the music he creates as Tocaio. At an early age, Ramirez showed deep rooted interest in music, finding inspiration by attending and organizing local shows in his hometown of Laredo, Texas. It wasn't until 2013, however, that Ramirez would find himself beginning to experiment with ambient and electronic music after relocating to Austin, Texas to attend film school at the University of Texas. Currently based in Los Angeles, California, Tocaio draws inspiration by experimenting with loop / effect pedals and synthesizers in his bedroom studio. \"The music is a soothing and wonderfully ambient affair incorporating field recordings of crackling fires, delicate beats along with live instrumentation. In parts, it sounds like Vangelis with a soul.\" \r\n   2017 saw the release of Tocaio's debut LP, \"Pointillism\" on Noise Revolt Records. The debut LP contains 13 unique and eclectic tracks Ramirez refers to as \"13 separate soundscapes.\" Known for incorporating live instruments into his live performances, Tocaio takes a different approach to creating and performing electronic music and ultimately, attempts to bridge the gap between electronic producers and rock bands.",

        "bio": "For years, Sonny Smith has built his own brand of indie-folk and rock & roll, growing into a cult favorite along the way. To those who know his work, he's an incredibly prolific creator, with a dozen albums to his name and a handful of related projects — including multiple stage plays, a full-length musical and his nationally-recognized art installation, \"100 Bands\" — under his belt. A longtime fixture of San Francisco's arts scene, he's managed to fly just beneath the mainstream's radar for decades, while still releasing a string of acclaimed records with labels like Fat Possum and Polyvinyl.\r\n\r\nOn his newest record, Rod For Your Love, he gets back to basics. Produced by Black Keys frontman Dan Auerbach and recorded in Nashville, Rod For Your Love roots itself in old-school, guitar-fueled rock & roll. These are love songs built for the garage and the dance floor, with big-hearted melodies and thick harmonies. It's the stuff you might've heard in the 1960s, back when groups like the Kinks and the Velvet Underground were making left-field pop songs that celebrated the form while still bending the rules. With stacked vocal harmonies that sweep their way throughout the track list, Rod For Your Love nods to the past while still moving forward. It's a classic-sounding album that still belongs to the 21st century.\r\n\r\nReleased on Auerbach's new label, Easy Eye Sound, Rod For Your Love was recorded at the end of a cross-country tour. Smith and his band were firing on all cylinders, their rough edges sanded down by weeks of nightly shows. Meanwhile, 10 new songs had been written. Smith, who'd fallen in love all over again with his roles as a bandleader and frontman, didn't want to produce the tunes himself in a home studio. He wanted to focus on the music. Having heard that the Arcs, Auerbach's side-project, had covered one of his own songs during their own tour, Smith reached out to the Black Keys singer. Connections were made, studio time was booked, and Smith wound up finishing that countrywide tour in Nashville, where he and his road band tracked the album at Auerbach's studio.\r\n\r\nThe goal? To shine a light on the songs and the band, without many overdubs or assorted clutter.\r\n\r\n\"I think a lot of albums are made in reaction to the one that came directly before,\" says Smith. \"My last record, Moods Baby Moods, was very layered and used a lot of drum machines. I was making weird sounds with synths. By the time we got to Nashville and began working with Dan, I was thinking 'Let's just make a fun, guitar-driven record. I don't want to have any extracurricular stuff here. I just want it to be really pure.'\"\r\n\r\nThe lyrics follow suit. A personal album filled with heart-of-sleeve songwriting, Rod For Your Love looks inward. It's autobiographical. Fittingly, it's also Sonny Smith's first solo album in years, following a string of records billed under his band's name, Sonny and the Sunsets. \"I'm writing about myself now, and not the people around me,\" he explains. \"It felt right to make it a solo record.\"",

But nighttime is when Clinton really gets to display his many talents: He's the hot headliner in an all-folk revue. Clinton sees potential in a 19-year-old he dubs the Kid (Heather Meuleman), takes the teen under his wing and instructs him (her?) in the tricks of the trade. However, Clinton learns there's a downside to the songwriters lifestyle when it threatens his romance with the Kid's sister. (also loosly based off Magic Mike)\r\n\r\nWith a decade of entertaining under their cuffs, Clinton and Heather are original members of Portland's mythical folk project The Jackalope Saints and Treefort music fest veterans. As Saints and members of local folk project Thistledown and The Pan Handles, they've played Northwest String Summit, Mogo Music Festival, and Sawtooth Valley Gathering, and shared stages with such acts as the Infamous String Dusters, Jeff Austin Band, Hot Buttered Rum, California Honeydrops,  Hot Buttered Rum, Joe Pug, Shook Twins and the Jay Cobb Anderson Band.  Make sure to tune in and see what tricks this reunited duo has in their hats for Treefort 2018.",

Katy Davidson started the band over 15 years ago in Portland and, before retiring the name in 2008, released three perfect full-lengths — 2001’s We’ll Have A Time, 2004’s Mountain Rock, and 2006’s There Is No Home — and countless 7″ and one-offs, most of which were collected on the Three States: Rarities 1997-2007 compilation. She also toured the world over with a rotating cast of band members, bringing her Pacific Northwest folk across the globe.\r\n\r\nDavidson kept making music after hanging up the Dear Nora hat, as Lloyd & Michael and Key Losers, but she reunited Dear Nora in early 2017 in celebration of a reissue of Mountain Rock, her favorite of the band's albums. It was released on vinyl on 1/13/17 via Orindal Records, the label started by Casiotone For The Painfully Alone’s Owen Ashworth. [Since then, she has recorded a brand new Dear Nora album which will be released in early 2018.] \r\n\r\n-James Rettig, Stereogum",

That doesn’t mean it’s all serious though! Competitions themselves are a good chance for dancers to showcase their own style. Win or lose, all dancers should feel hungry to grow more and work harder. Everyone is connected through dance and music so it brings people together to form a tight community. The most important part is having fun by either watching dancers exchange or being a part of that exchange. That being said, audiences at a dance battle event are participating by giving feedback and energy to the dancers who in turn give energy back.",

        "bio": "“A revolution without dancing is not a revolution worth having\" is a quote famously attributed to Author Emma Goldman. These words could be the motto of Emily Westman and Andrew Vait; better known as pop duo SISTERS.  \r\n\r\nWait Don't Wait is the band’s second full-length album (October, 2017) – and their first release via Tender Loving Empire.  Their debut LP, Drink Champagne (February, 2017) was met with a confluence of, “How were you able to release such a happy record right now?” and, “Thank you so much for releasing such a happy record right now!”; sentiments that are only amplified, strengthened and refined on Wait Don't Wait. \r\n\r\nMarch of 2017 in a cabin outside of Clinton, Washington: Westman and Vait hole up for a week.  Each day, they improvise from dawn until dusk as the cornerstones of songs emerge.  Each thread is built upon – developed with care, knowledge, and - most obviously - the joy of discovery.  As their time on the island draws to a close, the duo sits atop a quorum of tunes - enough to fill a record. \r\n\r\nApril of 2017 at Different Fur Studios; San Francisco, California:  Westman and Vait contact producer and studio owner, Patrick Brown, (Toro y Moi, K. Flay, The Morning Benders) to discover that a last-minute opening at the studio happens to coincide with the only open days in the musicians’ schedules.  The duo take residence at the studio for 10 days in April; eating, sleeping, tracking and mixing at the recording house that has hosted projects by Herbie Hancock, David Byrne, Stevie Wonder, Jonathan Richman, Earth Wind & Fire, and far too many others to mention.\r\n\r\nUtilizing the studio’s vast repository of vintage instruments, a borrowed baritone saxophone, and a few instruments brought from home, Westman and Vait lay down the 12 tracks.  Westman hops on the drum kit while Vait and engineer Bobby Renz look on from the control room.  Tape rolls; Westman pounds out the rhythm while Vait slices away on one of the dozens of synths within arm’s reach.  Brown pops his head in, listens, nods; someone makes a joke, everyone laughs and on to the next.  Before any memories can be cemented, the twelve tracks are complete.  Brown uses his wizardly mixing chops to cull the depth and breadth of the performances to the forefront, pumps up the bounce and sweetens the sheen.  The - albeit short - wait is over, and Wait Don't Wait is the resultant document; replete with catchy, quirky corkers overflowing with joy. \r\n\r\nWith the release of Wait Don't Wait, SISTERS are not only presenting another pop record full of bangers that demands repeat listens – they are also methodically working toward creating a world that is safe for everyone.  The thing called hatred; the thing called violence; the things that threaten life and love cannot survive in the face of true joy. SISTERS deliver unrestrained joy, and it is desperately needed right now. The world has been waiting, but it needs wait no more.",

Although the band announced their breakup in 2014, Monahan and Payne began writing and recording new material only weeks later. Engineered and produced by Monahan, the band has traveled as far as Japan to work on the new songs and to film material for upcoming music videos, which should be released in early summer. The songs also received additional engineering, mixing, and mastering from Mike Albanese (who performs with Maserati, Cinemechanica, and Bit Brigade) at Espresso Machine Recording in Athens. \r\n\r\n\r\nBetween 2010 and 2014, Easter Island performed at a number of festivals such as SXSW in Austin and CMJ in New York City. The band also received favorable press from Paste Magazine on a number of occasions, PopMatters, The Knife Fight and several other national publications. The song \"Proud\" from 2012's Frightened was licensed for the ABC series \"Off the Map\" and other songs from the band's catalog have been featured on other nationally broadcast television shows.",

The record was partially recorded in a barn in a beautiful pastoral setting in rural Oregon\r\n(true, but hasn’t everybody done this now?)\r\n\r\n2. The band lives in Portland, OR\r\n(also true, and they are consciously and unconsciously living breathing stereotypes just like the ones portrayed in Portlandia)\r\n\r\n3. Horse Feathers last album charted on Billboard by selling fewer records than they had in the past\r\n(true, but maybe more a comment on the music industry as a whole?)\r\n\r\n4. For this album, the band was influenced by the following: Pentangle, Talk Talk, Paul Simon, The Band, Van Morrison, John Wesley Harding era Bob Dylan, Desire era Bob Dylan, and Abner Jay (not what you would have guessed, right?)ertainly tried to change things a bit.",

        "bio": "Nestled in the picturesque bosom of Northeast Oregon's Grande Ronde Valley-- a place where one might see a wolf driving a hybrid, or a hippie eating a steak-- schemes a four-piece psych rock outfit know as Catskills. Through barren winter doldrums, the squinty-eyed summer, pornographic spring, and a purely Tarkus fall, these men scour the far corners of the valley of peace for clues as to why the American quilt unravels so, and to whom praise and blame is intended, or earned?\r\n\r\nWhat began as a dark, curious endeavor by prolific songwriter Gregory Rawlins and the creepy multi-instrumentalist Jeff Grammer immediately exploded into something like a chariot driven by the Headless Horseman once percussive virtuoso Andy Steele arrived in La Grande in late 2013. The final corner of this golden tablet was sealed when the stoic, and extra cool Wayne Marvin Callahan, or simply, 'Wayner' returned from an unforeseen sabbatical to Wisconsin. Wayner wanks bass.\r\n\r\n2015 was the year of the Strike Anywhere EP, including a twelve-minute drum solo textured beneath a reading of  'A Study of Moths,' by award-winning poet David Axelrod.\r\n\r\nThe following year came 'Rufus Dufur,' the band's full-length debut, recorded in two days by Bart Budwig in Enterprise, Oregon and subsequently released on legendary Curly Cassettes out of Portland. This album continues to chart new territory for the band, growing more conceptualized and cinematic, with one particular track that eclipses the 16-minute mark. In Rufus contains elements of punk, doom, ambient soundscapes, interludes, overtures, instrumentals, one gigantic, glorious wind chime, and of course, good old stinky garage rock.\r\n\r\nTheir sophomoric effort, General Consensus (a reference to the pseudo-fictitious war criminal of the same name) is set for recording in early 2018.",

The C/Z connection opened up doors for many successful national tours with Sunny Day Real Estate, Alcohol Funnycar, Monks Of Doom, and of course, Treepeople. We formed in 1988 and released two recordings: our self-released \"Demo Tape\" and Glenn's Car on the Silence Records label, produced and engineered by Drew Canulette (Soundgarden/Nirvana/Dharma Bums). An appearance at Treefort 2018 would be an honor for us to celebrate our 30th reunion.",

In 2017 he preformed at over 110 shows around the globe with his band Good Compny in support of his album \"The Iceberg.\"  He has been featured almost everywhere from Time Magazine and USA Today to Pitchfork and Rolling Stone.\r\n\r\nKnown in the music industry for his independence, Oddisee consistently debunks the scatterbrained artist myth - doing everything from booking international tours to photography to marketing and promoting himself and even other artists.

Rather than shouting from the rooftops in \"The World’s Greatest Party Band\", Wilson swoons and whispers over swirls of subtle psychedelia, Quincy Jones-era strings, and pulsing synths.\r\n\r\nWith echoes of Air, Bjork, Tame Impala, and Gary Numan, the band refers to its infectious brand of new wave electro-pop as \"Turbo Chill,” a sonic synopsis offered by the hosts of Adult Swim’s Stupid Morning Bullshit following the release of Wilson’s solo debut EP, Sunrise. Three years in the making, Change offers a challenge to fans of the iconic B-52’s, while cultivating a new generation of listeners.\r\n\r\nAfter four decades on the road internationally with The B-52s, Change represents a full circle for Wilson. Tapping into her own local stock in order to start anew, Cindy returned to the same town that nurtured her own creative roots: Athens, Georgia. Change features a “native” cast of Athenian musicians including Ryan Monahan (Easter Island, Monahan), producer/engineer Suny Lyons (PacificUV, Dream Boat), Lemuel Hayes (Ola Moon, PacificUV), and Marie Davon (powerkompany).\r\n\r\n“It’s very different from a B-52’s show,” Wilson recently told PopMatters. “I get to play around with different ideas and beautiful melodies. I don’t have to yell in a rock voice. I think you can get an emotional depth in the types of rooms we’re playing that you can’t find in larger rooms.”\r\n\r\nThe album Change was released on December 1st on Kill Rock Stars, and the band is currently touring the U.S. and Europe to promote the release.",

Cubicles collapsed, neckties unraveled, brief cases burned and fuzz pedals engaged.  With the smell of the 90's in the air, Jetski created their first record \"2PM\" in 2017.",

        "bio": "Perfectly imperfect - that’s one way to describe LA based punk act, The Regrettes. Writing songs that proudly bear a brazen and unabashed attitude in the vein of acts Courtney Barnett or Karen O - with a pop aesthetic reminiscent of 50’s and 60’s acts a la the Temptations or Buddy Holly - the LA based four piece create infectious, punk driven tracks.\r\n\r\nLead by outspoken frontwoman, Lydia Night, and comprised of Genessa Gariano on guitar, Sage Chavis on bass and drummer Maxx Morando, the group have left the LA rock scene floored, managing to capture the hearts of jaded rock critics while opening for acts like Kate Nash, Jack Off Jill, Bleached, Pins, Deep Vally and more. With nothing but demos available online, the group are already beginning to generate hype, from outlets like NPR, and with NYLON already heralding them them as a “punk act you should be listening to”.\r\n\r\nFrom the opening moments on a track by The Regrettes, we’re greeted with a wall of guitars, infectious melodies and a wistful nostalgia that continues right until the final notes. Taking cues from acts like Hinds and Hole, there’s a wistful sense of youth and vulnerability that lies at the heart of each song.\r\n\r\nA song by The Regrettes is, essentially, a diary entry into Lydia’s life. “My music is a spectrum of every emotion that I have felt in the last year, and you can hear that when you hear the songs. Everything that is happening in my life influences me. It’s everything from boys, to friends, to being pissed off at people, to being really sad. Just everything.”\r\n\r\nThe most intoxicating draw of The Regrettes is their bashful, heart-on-your-sleeve temperament - writing urgent and fast-paced pop songs with a punk rock mentality. “The way that we write, it’s all based on honesty,” muses Lydia on the group’s punk aesthetic. “If I finish a song, I’ll just leave it - I won’t really go back to it. I like things to feel in the moment and I don’t want it to be perfect. If I work on something too much I lose it and get bored and I want to do the next one..”\r\n\r\nLydia’s not afraid to have her feelings on display. “I am not scared of anyone judging me, I don’t care. I don’t give a fuck if someone doesn’t like what I have to say. For every person that likes you, there’s a person that doesn’t like you. No matter what, if people can relate to the music then it’s worth it. That’s what is cool for me.” And at the end of the day, isn’t that what punk music is all about?",

The band gained immediate industry attraction and they quickly joined forces with United Talent Agency (USA & Europe), Universal Music (Europe) and Sony ATV.\r\n“Sirens,” their first single, debuted in March 2015; it quickly received a million streams  and reached #5 on Spotify’s list of the Top 10 Most Viral Tracks in U.S.\r\nTheir second single, “You’re Mine”, garnered 8 millions plays on Spotify and landed in the service’s top 3 Most Viral Tracks as well as in the top 3 of Hype Machine’s Most Popular Tracks ranking.\r\n\r\nIn January 2016 their awaited debut EP was released via Anova Music under exclusive license to Barclay records (Universal France). Later that year, they teamed up with Madsonik and wrote \"Drift and Fall Again\" the main theme from Criminal's original motion picture soundtrack.\r\nIt wasn't long till the band dominated stages at big-named European festivals including Primavera Sound, Pohoda, Exit, Dockville, Pukkelpop, Montreaux, FNAC & intensively toured Europe.\r\nFollowing their breakthrough success, their debut album ‘Remember Roses‘ was released in June 2017. The leading single ‘Wishing Girl’ became a Spotify favorite, charted the top 40 German radio chart and was featured in an Ebay commercial.",

        "bio": "Having spent much of his life in a supporting role as a harmony singer and upright bass player, Alec Lytle began his solo music career at the urging of fellow musicians who convinced him that his personal songs deserved to be heard by a wider audience. Since then, he has played his nuanced acoustic music in clubs from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, New York, Anchorage, and Seattle, to cafés in Thailand, music venues in Brazil and on any field or mountaintop where he can tell his stories to a few empathetic listeners, or simply the wide open spaces... often with just his intimate voice, heartbreaking words, and the sound of his little Martin acoustic guitar.\r\n\r\nLytle also performs his music live with an ever-changing group of musicians known as Alec Lytle & Them Rounders featuring upright bass, mandolin, pedal steel guitar, percussion, and harmony vocals. Now, with his debut album The End of Ours and a new EP to be released in 2018, his aim is to take listeners for an experience that can remind them of a simpler and calmer time. Americana influenced music that he strives to fill with a sense of place... the tall pines, rolling hills, and blankets of enveloping coastal fog that define his home, the rural coastal mountains of Northern California.\r\n\r\nLytle wrote most of the songs for The End of Ours over the four years he lived in a yurt he built in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most nights were spent alone with the Pacific coastal fog collecting in the redwood trees overhead, dripping onto the canvas roof... Lytle often says that the solitude of living in the tent structure forced him to think about, and to ultimately write songs dealing with some painful events in his own life. In ‘The End of Ours’ the songwriter compiles a series of songs that document loss, from the end of relationships to the deaths of loved ones.",

        "bio": "Fruit & Flowers are one of the most active bands in the NYC area, and have been deemed one of \"NYC's Hardest Working Bands\" by Oh My Rockness. Fruit & Flowers' exuberant, electric performances draw a local following. Ana Becker's angular, expressive guitar style and Lyzi Wakefield's gritty rhythmic backbone merge a post-punk heaviness with psychedelic warmth. Committed and charismatic front woman Caroline Yoder summons a fervent energy, surrounded by distinct, warm and refreshing three part harmonies, the bedrock of Fruit and Flowers' sound.\r\n\r\nConceived in a Bushwick loft with broken AC during the summer of 2015 by Caroline on bass and Shaw Walters on drums, the band was soon joined by Lyzi Wakefield and Ana Becker on guitars and vocals. The band agreed to play its first show at Northside festival just weeks after formation and wrote the record in a furious fit of hot nights and inspired mornings. The band became fully realized when Shaw handed the role of drummer to Jose Berrio (drummer-cum-art director), whose inimitable style elevates the strong rhythmic character of the band.\r\n\r\nDrug Tax was born out of necessity, capturing the grit and rush of New York City summer and the newfound chemistry between the bandmates. Weaving together the perspectives and expressions of the band's multiple songwriters, Drug Tax unfolds to present the unique and varied voice of Fruit & Flowers. Lead single \"Out Of Touch\" is about the ennui of a missed love opportunity, with soaring, sultry vocals, beachy surf rock riffs and fuzzy bass. Album tracks range from the sultry moody and beautiful \"Dark Surf\" to the post-gothic title track \"Drug Tax.\"",

In March 2015, just after defending her Ph.D. thesis on migrants’ and refugees'integration in the Swedish labor market, she moved to Idaho with her husband, who was relocated from Micron Italy to Micron Boise. In November 2015, Sara joined the Boise office of the International Rescue Committee as an employment specialist. She currently works in the same office as a casework supervisor. Sara is not sure for how long she’ll call Boise her home.

His music is something fresh and distinctly new, yet is deeply woven in the spiritual fabric of our ancient ancestors. Surrounded by 5 guitars, 3 didgeridoos, an array of percussion instruments and decorated of symbolic ancestral nature, Green's stage appears to be a musical playground not for the faint of heart.\r\n\r\n\"I follow the music where it leads me. Through this process I find the music always comes from an honest place and that is most important in receiving the songs when they come through.\" What deepens the music is Trevor's ability to connect with his audience. Threading together sing-able and uplifting melodies, dynamic instrumentation, heart pounding rhythms and the haunting sounds of the didgeridoo, with his spontaneous improvisational ability, Green's performance is a one man powerhouse with universal appeal that seems to come from the ground up. With his honest delivery and ability to extricate the music from a deep place of truth, he leads his audience through vast landscapes of sound, weaving together a magnetic and spellbinding performance.",

        "bio": "Current Joys is the moniker for the music of Nicholas Rattigan. Formally known as TELE/VISIONS, Rattigan started the project through a series of experimental solo shows in Reno, Nevada. Performing with only a loop pedal and half broken guitar, Rattigan developed his repetitive and minimalist style which would go on to create the backbone of his work. In 2012, Rattigan released his first album under the project, Wild Heart, projecting himself into the Bandcamp bedroom-pop scene alongside other artists such as Alex G, Frankie Cosmos or Elvis Depressedly. Since then, Rattigan has released several albums and EP’s which twist and challenge his sound by experimenting with different genres and progressing themes of life, loss and intimacy. Much like Surf Curse, his other project with longtime friend Jacob Rubeck, most of Rattigan’s songwriting inspiration comes from film. By mixing the aesthetics of arthouse films like Tarkovsky’s The Mirror or Cronenberg’s Videodrome with real life experiences and sentiments, Rattigan creates a sense of magical realism and autobiographical storytelling with each one of his albums. Though his range of genre has varied over the years from 80s nostalgia in Wild Heart to haunting guitar anthems in Me Oh My Mirror, Rattigan’s music is all tied together by a simplicity and humanity that comes from his vulnerable lyricism and minimal songwriting style. Rattigan currently lives in Los Angeles, where he plays a major part of the DIY scene of Southern California.",

Timeless sounds of classic Americana with hints of cowboys, lost love, small towns, robots and truck drivers.

Following an impromptu name change, they agreed to part ways temporarily, in order for Tyler to focus on his first love... craft beer and bringing his wonderful creations to the masses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Corey continued to perform as a solo act, as well as the frontman for a Jazz/Swing combo called 'The Old Towne Sinners', until forming a country duo with Lyle \"Pops\" Evans of 'The Western Underground'(Chris Ledoux), called 'The Passengers'... Over the next few years, he observed, and learned from playing with many established acts/artists, such as: Pinto Bennett, Sergio Webb, Richard Soliz & The Blue Rayz, Hillfolk Noir, and Kip Attaway, among others, and shaping the sound that would define 'Fall Creek', until the two were ready, and able to hit the stage again. 'Fall Creek' came back with a bang in 2016... In early summer, 2017, they met Chad Lamer from Lawrence, Kansas, who would almost imediately become the full-time Bassist of the group. \r\n\r\nThe Boise based, honky-grass trio is now, slowly but surely, gaining the recognition, sharing songs about life, and generally having a damn good time.",

The three opened up for several big local boise hip hop shows. Such as Kool Keith, and Lyrics Born. Weighn also did several beat sets on his own in 2017 opening for the very talented emcees Billy Woods, and Coolzey.   \r\n  The three have been working on music for this project for two years. Originally set to do an Ep, Les Fortunate later was expanded to full length. . Digs brings his unique style and cadence, matched with Clevs wordplay and punches. Backed by Weighn's analog style production driven from years of digging in the crates. The Music is very underground. But also made to get people off their feet and dance. Funky beats and rhymes!",

As a teenager, Kweku transitioned to making his own music, crafting bedroom classics throughout high school. In 2015, just shy of his high school graduation, Kweku joined the Chicago's indie rap outfit Closed Sessions, and shortly after released his debut EP, Say It Here While It's Safe. The EP received critical praise and landed Kweku on Pigeons and Planes \"20 Rappers Under 20\" list. In 2016, Kweku followed up with Nat Love -- a proper LP that garnered an 8.0 Pitchfork review, produced a Pitchfork Best New Track, and landed Kweku in publications such as The FADER, Billboard, Chicago Reader, and more. Kweku's latest release, Grey, is available now via iTunes, Spotify, Tidal, and other digital retailers.",

Once childhood friends who covered songs in grandma's garage and the neighbor's basement with dreams of being rock stars in the early '90s, they accidentally grew up and followed diverging paths. Fast forward to 2012, those friends found their way home, and Far From Giants was born.\r\nThe summer of 2016 ushered in their debut album, No Brains Here. A gritty post-punk rock and roll album likened to a mix of Jawbreaker, Leatherface, and Thin Lizzy. No Brains Here was the crucial turning point in which Far From Giants was able to settle into a solid sound and direction, pushing them to write smarter, more poetic, and guitar-driven songs for another upcoming release currently slated for the summer of 2018.\r\nBacked by a wall of blistering melodies and a solid rhythm section, Far From Giants' stage presence never lets up for a moment and always leaves you wanting more.",

They've also worked as the house act in the lounge of a derelict Japanese cruise ship, playing for forgotten Hollywood stars under a slowly turning disco ball since the late 70's. Moreover, the three-piece creates landscapes of psychedelic R&B, marked by sophisticated arrangements, and a deep, dark heart.",

        "bio": "Starcrawler are a Los Angeles rock & roll band formed one year ago when Arrow de Wilde first met Henri Cash on the high school yard in Echo Park. The rhythm section of Austin Smith and Tim Franco came soon after, found on the streets of Hollywood. They play rock & roll music heavy and loud and their incendiary performances resemble the children of the Cramps, the Yeah Yeahs Yeahs, and Alice Cooper.\r\n\r\n\"Ants,\" a song they recorded days after first playing together, was quickly discovered by London DJ Matt Wilkinson and debuted on Apple Beats One radio just as the band were playing their first few shows. The DJ loved it so much, he played it twice in a row. Soon after, it found its way to Sir Elton John, who spun it on his \"Rocket Hour\" radio program, as well as to Zane Lowe, who played it to further accolades. Much media interest both from the music and fashion worlds has quickly followed. \"Ants\" & the forthcoming \"Used to Know\" are from an early session recorded by Steven McDonald (Red Kross) and document the unhinged beginnings of the group taking their first steps into the public eye. They have only now found the time to take a breath and are recording their more fully realized debut LP at Pax Am studios in Hollywood with Ryan Adams producing, due out later this year.\r\n\r\nAs a group, Starcrawler embodies that strange archetypal mojo that one finds in certain gangs of young rockers, only once or twice a generation; all the while still kicking and screaming as they sprint toward finding something new and entirely of their own. The band consists of Arrow de Wilde on lead vocals, Henri Cash on guitar, Austin Smith on drums, and Tim Franco on bass.",

        "bio": "\"Curtis and Sutton are gifted songwriters who have taken ques from Cohen and Cash and fearlessly mix the old with the new in creative ways\"  - No Depression\r\n\r\n“Cutis/Sutton & The Scavengers bear stringed instruments like timber wolves bare teeth” – American Standard Time \r\n\r\nCurtis/Sutton & the Scavengers are an Americana/Folk Blues band based out of Boise, Idaho.  Their sound is a hodgepodge of gritty-sweet roots music forged by the band’s two distinct songwriters, Charlie Sutton and Ryan Curtis.  The revolving cast of characters known as “The Scavengers” are anchored by full-timers, Sam Alkire on upright bass and Adam Straubinger on Fiddle. \r\n\r\nIn August of 2017, the band released the follow up to their acclaimed 2016 self-titled EP.  “Whiskey Rain” the band’s first full-length album marks a shift in their sound adding drums, fiddle and keys into the mix Sutton and Curtis share songwriting duties on the album’s 12 songs and together a very diverse yet sonically cohesive narrative is formed.  Equal parts Psychedelic Cowboy and Waits-esque Minor Blues, the sometimes rowdy, yet always soulful batch of songs quickly burn into your head and keep you humming along long after the record stops.  \r\n\r\nWhiskey Rain was recorded at Audio Lab Studios in Garden City, ID. The band enlisted Travis Ward from local stomp and holler legends, Hill Folk Noir to engineered and co-produced the album. In addition to his organic and near-low-fi production stamp, Travis can also be heard playing Jaw Harp on the record’s title track.  \r\n\r\nThe Scavengers have spent the last few years carving out a name for themselves as an electrified string band, with Sam Alkire providing the thumping backbeat on Upright Bass. However, the addition of drums on Whiskey Rain via Jason Beek (Eilen Jewell) is a welcome one, adding yet a new layer to their already dynamic sound.  The groups newest member, Florida Born, Adam Straubinger’s fiddle can be heard throughout the record adding a fresh juxtapose to Sutton’s signature banjo, guitar, and soulful resonator slide.   \r\n\r\nYou can catch the Scavengers out most weekends bringing their brand of high desert twang and swamp blues to the dives and haunts of Idaho and the greater Northwest. Check out iTunes or Spotify today to stream their latest release “Whiskey Rain.”",

Like a good wine or light beer, The GOV pairs well with all sorts of bands from extreme metal to bar rock and there’s enough songs in the band’s repertoire that The GOV can fit on funk or country bills as well.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Dustin Jones (guitarist, Green Jellÿ, Dying Famous), begged Glenn Mantang (singer, songwriter) to put together a live band to perform Glenn’s comedy songs he had been drunkenly recording in his basement since the 90’s. After some tactful badgering and promises of tasteful sideboob, The GOV was born in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe GOV recently released their first 13-track album entitled MeatUs to kick off a short Northwest tour and still have a closet full of other songs recorded and waiting to be recorded. 2018 will see the GOV touring the US, releasing more hilarious music videos, ending the year with a giant Christmas Pageant.",

        "bio": "Portland indie-folk songstress MAITA’s \"focused, American realist psalm...sets her far apart from her indie contemporaries (American Standard Time).” Her debut EP Waterbearer, released in 2017, is a rallying cry for the quiet warrior, the inquisitive seeker, and the fierce lover. Produced by Matthew Zeltzer, mixed by John Askew (Neko Case), and featuring some of Portland’s finest musicians—Dave Depper (Death Cab for Cutie), Skip VonKuske (Portland Cello Project), Tucker Jackson (The Delines), and Matthew Berger (Laura Gibson)—the arrangements on Waterbearer are minimalist yet rich, featuring hypnotic finger-picked guitar patterns flecked with washes of cello and guitar, with MAITA’s haunting melodies and beguiling poetry front and center.\r\n\r\nMAITA is currently hard at work on her debut full length, which is slated to be released in 2018. In her new single, Japanese Waitress, which was recorded completely live with Bart Budwig and features Cooper Trail and Nevada Sowle (Mise) on drums and bass, MAITA combines her confessional lyrics with frank storytelling. She weaves her own experiences of working in a Japanese restaurant as a half-Japanese woman, into the melancholic melodies that are so characteristic of her songwriting. While Japanese Waitress features some of MAITA’s most literal lyricism, the song’s many layers grapple with the complex themes of gender roles, femininity, racial prejudice, and the sacrifice that art often requires, all set within today’s America. The track previews a rich collection of full-band songs to be released in the fall. \r\n\r\nMAITA’s songs stand as a testament to the beautiful mess that we call life. She is an artist who seeks to explore the perilous act of creation and authorship, and we witness her lyrical negotiations of this in her music—the tenuous line between reverence and doubt, between worship and desecration. Her haunting voice and lush, off-center melodies guide the listener through her musings, at once deliberate and confessional. After years of writing and honing her abilities in private, MAITA has been sharpening her songs on the road, playing over 200 shows—including three month-long European tours—in 2016 and 2017.",

        "bio": "Slow Corpse was born out of the misty forests and craggy mountains of Southern Oregon in the fall of 2015. The group is the brain child of singer/producer Mitchell Winters, and guitarist Brenton Clarke. Both artists come from completely different musical backgrounds--Winters as the golden boy of Soundcloud, where he releases electronic music as PALMCO, and Clarke as a hard blues and shoegaze informed, one-man-musical-tour-de-force on the guitar. Rather than at odds with one another, their musical identities meld into a surreal blend of clean production and driving, yet dreamy melodies. Upon the release of their first two EP’s, Hound and Moons, Slow Corpse added multi-instrumentalist Cole Zollinger (Bass), hip-hop producer Dash Curtis (Keys), and Kelvin Underwood (drums) to their roster to create a live band which has brought them seemingly effortless success as a touring group. In the fall of 2017 they signed to indie label, Tender Loving Empire, where they join the ranks of indie darlings Andy Shauf, Y La Bamba, and Typhoon. You can find them making regular jaunts through the Northwest or bunkered down in Ashland, Oregon where they curate a magnetic and thriving DIY art/skate/music scene.",

        "bio": "Carlo Lamagna is the chef/owner of pop-up series Twisted Filipino Dinners and the forthcoming Magna in Portland, Oregon.\r\n\r\nDish: \r\nFilipino Pork\r\n\r\nBio:\r\nCarlo Lamagna was born in the Philippines, and lived in Detroit, Michigan until he was eleven, where he returned to the Philippines to attend high school and college.  It was in the Philippines that his palate started to develop and his interest in cooking started to take shape. Starting out as a psychology major in college, it wasn’t long before he made the change to pursue his passion for cooking and at twenty moved back to Michigan to be near his family and to begin his culinary career. \r\n\r\nLamagna cooked at several restaurants and private clubs in Detroit all while attending Macomb Culinary Institute to pursue his first Associates Degree in the culinary field.  From experience  at the prestigious Detroit Athletic Club to time spent learning sushi and helping a friend open a Thai restaurant, Carlo kept seeking out opportunities to learn and grow in the field.  It was his training at the Country Club of Detroit though, under Certified Master Chef Brian Beland, that helped solidify his fundamentals and push him toward the next level of his career.  It was at the CCD that he decided that he wanted to further his education and went on to attend the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York.\r\n\r\nCarlo's time at the CIA was used to further develop his understanding of cooking fundamentals as well as taking advantage of the close proximity to Manhattan and it's surrounding boroughs.  Carlo would travel into the city during weekends to stage in as many of the top restaurants as he could.  It was his experiences in the city and school that created a desire to continue to pursue a higher level of cooking.  \r\n\r\nAfter graduating with honors from the CIA, Carlo moved to Chicago and worked under chef Bruce Sherman at North Pond where he learned the importance of seasonality and supporting local farmers and purveyors.  Carlo quickly rose through his ranks and was promoted to sous chef in nine months.   After spending two years there it was Carlo's drive to improve that led him to Europe, traveling and staging in Germany, France and Spain to gather more culinary perspective. It was in Germany at the historical Romantik Hotel Spielwig, under chef Karl Joseph Fuchs, that his love and appreciation for butchery, charcuterie, and sausage making was honed.  \r\n\r\nBack in Chicago, Lamagna started working with chef Paul Virant, whose vast knowledge of preserving and pickling opened Lamagna’s eyes to a different way of incorporating these techniques in upscale cooking.  Beginning as a chef tournant on the opening team, Carlo quickly became sous chef and eventually chef de cuisine.  During his time there, the Perennial Virant team received many accolades, including recognition by the Michelin Guide on the Bib Gourmand list.   It was at the same time he began his pop-up series, Twisted Filipino, which was dedicated to his father, who had passed away in 2009.  These dinners helped him explore and push the boundaries of Filipino cuisine by mixing traditional flavors with modern techniques.\r\n\r\nLamagna then moved on to his first Executive Chef position at Benny's Chophouse, where the accolades continued to follow, including top three steakhouses according to Chicago Magazine.  Although his time at the steakhouse was short, it was during his time there that Carlo was offered a job across the country in Portland, Oregon at the James Beard nominated and nationally recognized Clyde Common.\r\n\r\nAt Clyde Common, Carlo quickly adapted to the bustling atmosphere and helped breathe new life into the established restaurant and bar.  With the encouragement of owner Nate Tilden, Carlo began pushing the menu to reflect his personal experiences.  It was there that he started adding Filipino flavors and dishes to the menu and helped introduce Filipino cuisine to a broader market.      The Portland food scene began to take notice and embrace the otherwise then unfamiliar cuisine.  \r\n\r\nAfter three and a half years at the helm of Clyde Common, Carlo Lamagna stepped down to continue to educate and showcase his passion for Filipino food through his popular Twisted Filipino Dinner Series while perfecting his own restaurant concept for Magna, a Filipino restaurant.\r\n",

        "bio": "illest*Lyricists consists of Hip Hop emcee's LSD & Mic ill known for their clever wordplay & phenomenal delivery. They are often accompanied by Turntablist Chucky Norris as well, the illest*Lyricists official Dj. These two emcee's met at a open mic session often rivaling each other, because no one else would dare to grab the mic when they were on stage. The reaction they would get from the crowd was always very positive so they decided to combine forces & start the group illest*Lyricists, forming in early 2011. Both emcee's are no strangers to the hip hop scene. LSD has been rapping since 1998, has opened for many famous acts, released 3 CD's solo, & with Los Filthy Hooligans. Mic ill has been rapping since 2005 and has also released 4 cd's himself. 2 with his group M.O.C. & 2 solo releases as well. Their 1st official release Illest*Ep quickly became a fan favorite. Then they followed up with The Temple of iLL there full LP. Described as a lyrical journey with beats that rattle your body & a delivery like no other!  Both mic.ill & LSD are also working on 2 more solo projects as well , so be on the look out.

        "bio": "Taylor Kingman makes music that resets the clocks. You know the feeling of standing beneath a trestle on a hard day, a can of cheap beer, flicking a lighter and dreaming up wild ideas until a heavy train comes thundering overhead and you scream and scream until your voice gives out and you feel lighter? That’s the thing that lives deep in Taylor’s songs. There’s something so rubbed-raw honest and drunken-truth about them. You can’t help but be transfixed and transformed.\r\n​\r\nBorn in Portland, OR and raised in Marion County, Taylor picked up a guitar and started writing at 12. In high school, he formed The Hill Dogs, a raucous, powerful band that hit hard beneath his explosive lyrics. After graduating, he wrote like a madman, played out heavily with the band, and taught guitar on the side.\r\n​\r\nIn 2015, Taylor packed up and headed to Portland where he played anywhere and everywhere with The Hill Dogs until he blew out his voice and had to halt the band. The restrictions of his healing vocal chords gave way to a deluge of new writing. Taylor joined multiple projects around the city with some of Portland’s finest and recorded his debut solo album Wannabe at the great Mike Coykendall’s studio, due out November 17th on Mama Bird Recording Co. He recently formed ‘TK and the Holy Know Nothings’ with Lewi Longmire, Jay Cobb Anderson, Tyler Thompson, and Josh Simon as a vehicle for a growing ocean of new material.\r\n​\r\nOf writing songs, Taylor says, “Each word is a world waiting to swallow me whole. I get drunk off the pitter patter poetry of lines that root me to the cold, unforgiving ground, all at once, drowning me in the violent beautiful futility of humanity, yet, also, set fire to my eyes, sending me swirling and whirling, floating blind and thoughtless through the maze of the mind. I want the words to explode bloody in all their truth, for better or worse. Vivid images dripping with feeling bursting like lightbulbs in the back of the head.” Enough said. Train thundering. Sparks raining down.",

Unassumingly serving as a supporting act playing frequent weeknight gigs, the auspicious quartet has been steadily making a name for itself with a smart brand of guitar­driven pop rock, which has plenty in common with acts like Echosmith, Metric and Florence and the Machine. Made up of three former members of Red Fox Run (guitarists Joshua Hester and Seth Beamer and drummer Caleb Thoemke), the foursome isled by the soaring vocals of Emma Drae, whose expressive voice evokes the silken strains of Ellie Goulding and Hayley Williams. The music is instantly memorable and it’s a safe bet that by the time the act finishes work on its debut recordings, which it's working on now, the outfit will be packing shows of its own as the main attraction.",

        "bio": "A scrappy, genre-blending project fronted by chronic collaborator, podcast host, and wordsmith Yoni Wolf, WHY? is an indie rock outfit founded in the Bay Area of California. The act signed with the revered Anticon label for its debut, a partnership that developed out of Wolf's college friendship with Anticon artist Doseone. While WHY? does incorporate rap and spoken lyrics into its music, it became one of the more indie rock-styled acts on the usually hip-hop-leaning label. An enigmatic Split EP with Odd Nosdam was WHY?'s first release for the label in 2002, followed a year later by the full-length Oaklandazulasylum. Both the Sanddollars EP and the Elephant Eyelash LP were issued in 2005. The following year saw the Rubber Traits EP, and in 2008 the Alopecia album hit shelves and became their first to hit the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart. Featuring Mark Erickson along with Fog's Andrew Broder, Eskimo Snow arrived in 2009 and also landed on the independent albums chart. The title for their next effort, 2012's Mumps, etc., was inspired by contracting the disease while in Europe, along with other \"on tour\" calamities. For its sixth studio album, WHY? moved to Joyful Noise, which had released the 2016 debut of Wolf's duo with rapper Serengeti, Yoni & Geti. Co-produced by Yoni Wolf and his brother, Josiah, Moh Lhean was released in 2017. It was the first fully home-recorded WHY? LP since the project's debut.",

The Denver three piece layers falsetto harmonies over reverb kissed guitar lines and punchy drums to create a sound that takes equally from heavy psych and saccharine pop. The Kinky Fingers straddle the line between aesthetics as well as any band might–skating down a meandering jam while crafting hook after hook.

The group started as a four piece and asexually reproduced a fifth member in 2017, resulting in a 5 piece mix of heavy guitar/keyboard layers blended with pop hooks/melodies/harmonies and occasional total noise freakouts; often compared to The Pixies and The Yeah Yeah Yeahs.  In 2 years, Prism Bitch has gone from punk rock coffeehouse open mics to nominations in the Weekly Alibi’s \"Best of Burque” 2017 music awards (for Best New Band, Best Party Band, and Best Stage Presence). In the last year Prism Bitch has had the privilege of sharing the stage with Shonen Knife, Le Butcherettes, and The Nots. PB spent the end of November in the studio in LA with Toshi Kasai, known for his work with The Melvins, Foo Fighters and Dave Matthews Band. Prism Bitch has a reputation for wild and performative shows, professionalism and friendship.",

She writes on everything from politics to the supernatural while inhabiting a sonic space somewhere between shoegaze, folk, dark-wave & experimental.\r\n\r\nCogan’s new album 'Crickets' was released on Hand Drawn Dracula in November 2017. Crickets was recorded and co-produced with Tom Deis (Uni Ika Ai) in Philadelphia and features percussionist Dani Markham (TuneYards, Childish Gambino), violinist Russel Kotcher (Chamber Orchestra of NY) and vocalist Maia Friedman (Uni Ika Ai).\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, Ora Cogan has collaborated with a wide variety of artists from a gospel quartet to no-wave ensembles as a multi-instrumentalist and songwriter. She started releasing material with her solo project on Borne! Recordings in Spain and Isolated Now Waves in Canada in 2010 leading her to tour extensively in North America & Europe. Cogan has released 7 albums and has been invited to perform at  festivals around the world. \r\n\"Multi-instrumentalist Ora Cogan makes gorgeous experimental folk compositions laced with hints of psychedelia, chamber pop, and rock.\" - She Shreds \r\n“Ora Cogan, the Montreal-based folk musician, has built a reputation for her multi-faceted compositions. Under one roof, Cogan has drawn folk, psych, dream pop, chamber pop and beyond as she crafts intense, beautiful songs.” – The 405 \r\nAn ode to the cruelty of the world it might well be, but at its opulent meridian, ‘Moonbeam’ offers the kind of poignant and powerful escape that will lead you to return over and over again.”- Gold Flake Paint",

The trio’s latest record, Vaca (2017), is their first release without Ikey Owens (keyboardist for Jack White & The Mars Volta) at the helm -- who recorded, produced and played on the first albums and toured with Rubedo -- as Owens passed away unexpectedly in late 2014. Stunned, upset and unsure how to proceed without their unspoken fourth member, the trio decided to push themselves into uncharted territory, recording with musician/producer Johnny Bell at JazzCats Studios in Owen’s hometown of Long Beach, CA.\r\n\r\nThe result is Vaca, a glimmering pop-minded piece of sonic catharsis, a therapy session created in honor of Ikey Owens. Unlike Rubedo’s past psych-rock leanings, Bell’s production takes the band’s specialty as a live act and translates that spirit into recorded form. It was mixed by the godfather of grunge Jack Endino and mastered by Dave Cooley of Stones Throw Records.\r\n\r\nVaca is a record of Rubedo’s 20-plus years of friendship, a partnership with old school Denver roots, and an indelible Long Beach connection.",

Since forming Land of Talk in 2006, the one certainty in her life has been uncertainty, as her band has gone from being one of Montreal's most brash, buzzy indie rock acts to one of its most elusive and enigmatic. After recording Land of Talk's debut EP, Applause Cheer Boo Hiss, Elizabeth lost her drummer (the first in what would become a semi-regular pattern of line-up changes). After releasing Land of Talk's first full-length record Some Are Lakes in 2008, she lost her voice. And after the 2010 follow-up Cloak a... , she lost her will. \r\n\r\nElizabeth knew she needed a break from the album/tour/album/tour cycle after Cloak and Cipher's release—she just didn't plan on it becoming a full-blown hiatus. \"I was just tired and felt a little disenchanted,\" she says. \"I think that's very common—to feel industry-weary. I just couldn't do it. The only thing that was keeping me there was the music, and I think the music had become a footnote of the whole story. I wanted to get back to the music.\"",

        "bio": "Cults made their name in black and white. A pair of film school dropouts who burst onto the New York scene with a perfect single and a darkly retro sound, the band’s first two albums play like noirish documentaries on a lost girl group. Four years after Static, Cults returns with Offering, an exciting collection of songs bursting with heart, confidence, shimmering melody and buzzing life. The time off has given the band new energy and new ideas–Cults are working in Technicolor now.  \r\n\r\nThe core duo remains the same. Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion, both 28, still live in New York. They still finish each other’s thoughts and still share a love of catchy music and black humor (this is a band that sampled cult leader Jim Jones on their first hit). But the pair have put some blood on the tracks since their breakout debut: they’ve toured the world, built a devoted audience, survived a breakup, grown up in green rooms, parted ways with their old label and made a home of their new one. After the whirlwind of Static died down, Follin and Oblivion made a conscious decision to shift gears:\r\n\r\n“I feel like we stepped into a tour van when we were 21, and basically didn’t get out of it for the next few years,” Oblivion says. “We wanted to give ourselves some space to have normal lives, and wait until there was something new to say.”\r\n\r\n“It was exciting, because writing stopped feeling like a homework assignment. I was able to sit down and do it only when I wanted to,” says Follin. “These songs are less art projects, less thinking ‘this is a heartbreak song, what would Lesley Gore do?’ and more reflective of things that have happened in our own lives.”\r\n\r\nCults took their time, going through a few dozen discarded demos before arriving on a pair of songs that felt special– the rollicking, sweet-but-dark “Right Words” and the buzzy earworm “Recovery.” Once they had a direction, Follin and Oblivion enlisted longtime engineer Shane Stoneback to help guide the sessions, working bit by bit, never rushing, letting the material develop naturally. \r\n\r\nOffering will thrill ride-or-die Cults fans. Songs like “Natural State” and “Good Religion” balance on the same after-hours wall of sound that brought the band its early audience. The title track, a rolling goth-ed out anthem for the kids in the back of class is surely, somewhere in an alternate universe, soundtracking an 80s prom movie directed by Jim Jarmusch.   \r\n\r\nBut Offering goes places Cults haven’t gone before. Pink Floyd was a big inspiration, freeing up the band to try new song structures and play with vintage synths, notably on the gorgeous, aching “With My Eyes Closed.”“I had the classic high school discovery of Pink Floyd, only I was 24,” laughs Oblivion. “I was in the back of the tour van, listening to Dark Side of The Moon on headphones for the first time, and I turned to the band and said ‘guys. GUYS.” New Wave was also a touchstone, you can hear The Motels and Gary Numan’s influence on chugging pop gems “Clear From Far Away” and “I Took Your Picture.” None of these gestures are accidental, the band has developed a confidence in the studio and a strong, full sound. Gone are the days of chancing upon Garageband alchemy; Offering is the work of two artists who know what they want and how to make it happen.  \r\n\r\nOffering also marks the beginning of a more collaborative phase for Cults. The pair have always traded ideas, but for the first time they sat down to jam out ideas together in a room. Follin, who has always written her own parts, came into her own as instrumentalist during the Offering sessions, playing drums and keyboards throughout. Her equal partnership with Oblivion flies in the face of a far-too-common industry assumption that women are passive participants in their own art.\r\n\r\nAfter three years of work in New York, LA, San Francisco, in studios and sweaty living rooms, the band finished the bulk of recording. But it was a classic “last day in the studio” demob-happy session that gave the album its opener and title track, a hope-in-darkness song that Oblivion calls “one of the most outward-looking things we’ve done, it’s a lifeline.” Follin adds: “we both decided independently of each other that it had to be the title.”\r\n\r\n“These songs have both instability and solutions for how to deal with instability,” Oblivion says. “I think my favorite lyric is from “Took Your Picture”: Tinge of blue/To the end/left our hearts/With regrets/I’m learning. That’s as close as you get to a thesis statement for the album.”\r\n\r\n“We’re in a happier place,” Follin adds. \r\n\r\n“I mean, the last track on our last album was called ‘No Hope,’” Oblivion says, and they both laugh. “The first track on this record is called ‘Offering.’ That pretty much says it.”\r\n\r\n* Written by Fred Nicolaus",

Out of that psychotropic smoothie straw test tube crawled a hermaphrodite child who laughed in the face of modernity. It’s name was Uni. Where Uni looked it saw glitter and blood. Sutures on the dance floor and diamonds in the graves. Where Uni stepped it left flowers and what it touched burned violet and yellow. Uni used their guitars like a Tesla coil to summon electricity from the sky with cathedral amplifiers floating into an ocean of feedback and delay. That very flood freed three slaves and welded them into a single psychedelic hydra: \r\n\r\nKemp, the brain of Uni! ...Nico Fuzz, the heart of Uni!...David Strange, the balls of Uni! They wore high heels embroidered with stars to elevate them above the filth the enemy had spread like fecal peanut butter on planet earth. Kemp was the half crazed Boudicca who piloted the spaceship with her Orpheus rock riffs and led their armies into battle. David Strange was the warrior poet who could build anything with his bare hands and write lyrics to mesmerize the harpies, while summoning the devil on his double neck. Nico had flowers in his hair and broken glass under his nails. He wanted to heal the tectonic plates and could speak to insects. He sung like Orpheus and had one foot in the underworld, one foot in the future. Those who heard their music saw through the neckties of lying politicians and the banality of modern pop stars, freeing themselves at last from a digital prison. So Uni was immediately black listed from the radio and issued a warrant for indecent exposure charges which forced them to go permanently underground. It’s unknown where or when Uni will strike again. They appear without warning and claim responsibility for miracles in the strangest corners of the world. The number of followers that Uni has is rumored to be growing although few will actually admit to being a follower of this controversial cult.",

        "bio": "Ealdor Bealu is a 4-piece psychedelic band from the high desert of Boise, ID. Beginning in the summer of 2015 with Carson Russell (Guitar, Vocals), Rylie Collingwood (Bass, Vocals), Alex Wargo (Drums) and Travis Abbott (Guitar), Ealdor Bealu brought forth a formidable multi-genre sound ranging from heavy-psych/doom to post-rock and post-punk. With a focus on shifting dynamics from the ambient to the massive and back again, and the influence of the raw natural enormity of the Northwest landscape around them, Ealdor Bealu curates a mosaic of sounds to paint a picture of the world around them. From the still silence of the morning’s first light to the crushing depths of the ocean floor, their sound is both minimalist and maximalist with hints at the unknown core of our existence and the world beyond this reality. Combined with vintage b/w cinematic visuals and an intensely passionate live show, each performance provides a feeling of both exuberant stimulation and utter catharsis.\r\n\r\nAs an emerging figure in the Northwest Heavy-Psych/Post-Rock community, Ealdor Bealu has had the honor of sharing the stage with the likes of Acid Mother's Temple(Japan), This Patch of Sky(OR), WEEED(WA), Barrows(CA), and Castle(CA) among others. Festival appearances have included Treefort Music Fest 2016 and 2017, Ranchfest 2016, and Off-Beat Music Fest 2017.\r\n\r\nEaldor Bealu's debut full-length album DARK WATER AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN was independently released June 9th, 2017, followed by an 8-date Summer 2017 Northwest Tour in support.  The band's first offering has drawn local, regional, and even international praise as a standout in the realms of the ambient psychedelic universe.  \r\n\r\n\"The Boise-based four-piece of guitarist/vocalist/spearhead Carson Russell, guitarist Travis Abbott, bassist/vocalist Rylie Collingwood and drummer/percussionist/saxophonist Alex Wargo bring the 56-minute offering to bear with marked patience and impress in the complexity of their arrangements and the identifiable human core that lies beneath them.\" \r\n-The Obelisk\r\n\r\n\"The quartet evolves into a sound at the edge of shoegaze, with small touches of originality such as the presence of a saxophone from time to time. I can't help but feel bewitched by not only the music, but also by the voice of the singer...\"\r\n-La Planète du Stoner Rock\r\n\r\n\"Shifting between a mesmerizing 7 tracks of ambient, echoing revelation Ealdor Bealu have crafted a debut release as vast as it is purposeful.\" \r\n-Nanobot Rock \r\n\r\n\"The band's debut album, Dark Water at the Foot of the Mountain (self-released, 2017), is both dazzling and menacing. It combines solemn melodies, measured tempos, sinuous guitar lines and roaring distortion to create a sonic blend of beauty and power.\" \r\n-Boise Weekly \r\n\r\n\"The traction of the music is desultory, undulant, as if one has wandered to land's end to face an ocean complicated by a hallucinogenic vision. All seems to end, even as it begins ever anew; or as poet Wallace Stevens once wrote: \"Death is the mother of all beauty\".\" \r\n-Boise Underground Music Pages\r\n\r\nFor fans of: Black Mountain, Earth, Chelsea Wolfe, Mark Langan",

        "bio": "It's not uncommon for musicians to grow and evolve between releases -- but even by those standards, the Districts' Popular Manipulations is stunning. The Pennsylvania-borne band's third full-length represents an exponential leap in sound and cohesion, an impressive and impassioned burn with a wide scope that threatens to swallow everything else surrounding it. Perhaps it's a cliché to say so, but while listening, you might find yourself wondering why people don't make indie rock like this anymore.\r\n\r\nThe total electric charge of Popular Manipulations is just the latest evolution for the impressively young quartet, whose founding members -- vocalist/guitarist Rob Grote, bassist Connor Jacobus, and drummer Braden Lawrence -- have known each other since attending grade school together in the Pennsylvania town of Lititz. After deciding to form a band in high school, the Districts gigged hard in the tri-state area, releasing a slew of promising material (including the rootsy 2012 debut Telephone) before catching the eye of venerable indie Fat Possum. 2015's A Flourish and a Spoil found the band refining their embryonic sound with veteran producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, Kurt Vile) -- and looking back on that release, there are glimmers of Popular Manipulations in chrysalis form to be found on it, hints of the fence-swinging anthemic sound they'd soon make wholly their own.\r\n\r\nAfter touring behind A Flourish and a Spoil, Grote began \"playing with different ideas\" in his own songwriting by making demos at a prolific pace. \"We knew that we wanted to change some things musically, so we were trying to come up with as many songs as possible to narrow the direction we wanted to take the material,\" he states. In total, they ended up with 50 song ideas, and so they were off to LA in May of 2016 with new guitarist Pat Cassidy in tow to log more recording time with Congleton, with four of Popular Manipulations' songs coming out of the sessions.\r\n\r\n\"We have a lot of overlapping tastes and preferences for how things are made,\" Grote gushes about working with the notably reliable studio wizard -- but acceding all credit to Congleton (who also handled the record's mixdown) would be shortchanging the Districts themselves, who went on to self-produce the remainder of the record in Philadelphia with engineer Keith Abrams. \"Something we took from working with Congleton was ideas on arranging songs,\" Grote explains, and they certainly learned a lot: Popular Manipulations is a raucous and impressively thick-sounding album, overflowing with toothy melodies that pack a serious punch.\r\n\r\nFor such weighty thematic material, though, Popular Manipulations is purely life-affirming rock music, bursting with energy that cuts through the darkness of the world that surrounds us. \"We're a much better distillation of who we wish to be as a band,\" Grote reflects on the journey that has led the Districts to this point. \"We've figured out how to distill the things we've been trying to accomplish as a band, musically and lyrically. We've always viewed making music as something we're trying to do better the whole time.\" Mission accomplished.",

This era often left people with a sense that they had just seen a man unhinged trying to tell them something sacred in the form of a song, or something, they weren't too sure what they saw. After a few tours on his own, in 2010 Ed asked Devlin to help him expand the songs with his limited knowledge of the bass guitar. Now the \"live\" show is one guy playing a drum with a light shining, singing his ass off and another dude with a bass, in the dark laughing at the other guy's jokes.",

        "bio": "Trevor Oswalt (a.k.a. East Forest) is a unique bird in the Wild West aviary of electronic music. While his shamanic ambient electropop can be contextualized along with Aphex Twin, Philip Glass and Sigur Ros, the fundamental mission of his project is to create sonic architecture for others to explore their own inner space. Thus, it is a process of opening doorways for the listener to walk through, which takes patience. Patience, while typically thought of as kryptonite in the instant gratification, hyper-speed world of music, might just be the medicine we need.\r\n \r\nNature indelibly made a huge impression on Oswalt, who grew up in the Pacific Northwest. He spent a decade in NYC, where he discovered indigenous traditions and began cultivating source recordings from sound healings and mushroom ceremonies. Eventually he started leading underground ceremonies across the country. Playing in the private shadows allowed the patient sound of East Forest to emerge:  an emotional and spacious lexicon born out of a practical need to play solo for six hours, while guiding a room full of listeners in deep meditation.\r\n \r\nWord organically spread as a devoted community shared his early albums, leading to glowing nods of approval from the likes of NPR and Wired. He completed multiple tours across the U.S. and Europe and shared his mission on the stage of TEDx while performing in a diverse range of settings, from SXSW to Grace Cathedral, as well as private parties for the likes of Google. As his diverse catalogue emerged (14 releases total), the music evolved from extended, ambient jams to more concise, structured material with vocals – a vivid mix of the digital and analog realms with a social and spiritual underpinning. “I’ve always been inspired by the natural world and the psychedelic experience” Oswalt asserts, cementing his position on plant medicine, which he has often implemented in his recording process. “I prefer to operate where my intuitive musical mind can speak and something larger can come through.”\r\n \r\nHis newest release, a deluxe version of his 2017 album CAIRN, drops January 26th, 2018 – rounded out by several unreleased B-Sides and select remixes. The original sessions took place in the high desert of Utah at Oswalt’s Boulder Rock Studios with the assistance of electronic producer Keith Sweaty. It was a highly collaborative project that also featured trumpet by Brad Lee of The Album Leaf and rhymes by Scarub of Living Legends, along with strings by the ‘Bizarre Star Strings’ trio (Band of Horses, My Morning Jacket, Joanna Newsom). The bulk of the material explored the collapse of a long-term relationship and the fundamental changes that result, both in the personal sense, as well as in a global level.\r\n \r\nA cairn is traditionally a stack of stones that marks a trail in the wilderness. Come across a marker and you know you’ve reached a point in the trail. Trails in turn lead somewhere: the destination we hope to reach. Reflecting on the album title, Oswalt notes “The past year I was going through a divorce and immense changes which caused me to riff on this idea – where do I go from here? I was looking for signs to show me the next step and was also interested in leaving a marker for others, if I found a way of my own.”",

        "bio": "Based out of Boise, ID, Ana Lete is, “a band to watch out for,” according to the Revue. Neo-indie folk singer/songwriter, Ana Lete, creates music that is authentic, emotive, and surreal. In her songs, Lete isn't afraid to sing her truths and push the musical envelope.\r\n\r\nLete’s journey began in January 2015, when her guitar instructor passed away unexpectedly. Hit with a deep wave of grief, Lete had no choice but to begin songwriting to heal her pain.\r\n\r\nBut as the year continued, she found songwriting useful in capturing other aspects of her life too – from breakups to loss of friendship to memorable moments in time with friends.\r\n \r\nBy combining captivating lyrics, jazz-inspired vocals, and 2.5 years of classical guitar training, Lete developed an experimental neo-indie folk sound that the Revue has described as “something you would expect to see from a veteran artist.\" Northwest Music Scene has commented that she is “Boundary-pushing” and “woos audiences with her heartfelt and enchanting vocals.” Those who do attend Lete’s shows often find themselves emotional and teary-eyed during her sets.\r\n\r\nIn September 2016, Ana Lete released her first EP, Psychic Translation. Now, Lete is in the studio recording her debut full-length, Eternal Hibernation, which will be released in Fall 2018.",

        "bio": "Sol Rising’s original soundscapes evoke feelings of inspiration and bliss through an eclectic mix of electronic music, mid-tempo house, chill-trap, ambient and hip-hop. \r\n\r\nBorn in Vancouver BC, raised in Fairfield Iowa, Sol Rising began meditating at age four with a walking mantra technique. His mother took him to visit numerous spiritual teachers, who inspired him on the spiritual path he walks today. As a teenager, he became a hip hop fanatic. His rooted interest in hip hop led him to learning the art of scratching — using turntables as musical instruments. Sol Rising soon became one of America’s top scratch DJs, winning second place at the DMC, the world’s most prestigious DJ competition.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating in the top 5% of his accounting class at University of Iowa, he realized accounting was not his path. A journey to India illuminated his true calling — to light up people’s awareness of their true nature through music. This lead him to study audio engineering and production at Pyramind Studios in San Francisco, CA.\r\n\r\nNow a successful Producer/DJ, with over 6 albums released, Sol Rising plays events throughout the US, Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia at festivals such as Wanderlust, Burning Man, Symbiosis and Lightning in a Bottle. Sol Rising has licensed music for Apple, US Polo and has been featured in major media outlets including the Yoga Journal, Washington Post. Sol Rising has also been streamed over 3.5 million times on Spotify.",

Blurring barriers, at Red Rocks & Meow Wolf they handed out a seemingly infinite supply of googly eyes and fed oysters to the audience.\r\n\r\nThe band’s previous album was released in partnership with Misra Records and Sub Pop Licensing.

When we last caught up with this Bay Area BBQ gaucho on his debut, Nashville Dreams, he'd hit that special zen layer of loserdom. He'd thrown up his hands into the folly of failure. He was the affable, bumbling red-cheeked drunk lurking around the edges of the cookout - bumming smokes, putting down all the white wine and cocktail shrimp he could get away with. But now, a couple years on, that early-30s existential dread has crept its way into Dick's purview. With his sophomore long-player In Heaven, Stusso's numbered human days are on his mind. Without stumbling into pomposity, Dick has taken back the wheel on his life and is doing a bit of hotdogging.",

The Suffers have quickly progressed from packing Houston venues to accepting invitations nationally for featured performances at notable festivals and events, all while still remaining a local Houston favorite, accepting 23 Houston Press Music Awards in the last four years.",

After writing our first e.p. in the dark and polluted streets of North Hollywood and playing our first show on stage at Burning Man we were drawn to connect back with our roots to a more unified life in the Northwest where we continue to tell our story. \r\n\r\nWith electronic elements, live drums and sultry vocals we write to tell tales of rites of passage, traveling the world, spiritual growth and of love and loss. We are dream chasers who are hopeful for a time and place when music and art is celebrated and shared. What we desire is to create a fire within the cold world we’ve come to know.

Offering 20 rotating taps and a variety of styles, Edge has become one of Boise's favorite spots. Edge also has a passion for local, hand-crafted food. Striving to be creative and support local farms, Edge's menu has a wide variety of house-made, beer-infused recipes that stand far above the usual pub food scene. \r\n\r\n1.) What is your favorite Idaho Ingredient?\r\nOne of my personal things to enjoy is good artisan bread. Boise has some amazing bakers and we chose Acme Bakeshop in our pub because the bread makes it all come together. I also love using the fresh herbs available here, as well. Purple Sage Farms supplies us with many of them.\r\n\r\n2.) What is your favorite Idaho Beverage?\r\nOne of my favorite beverages would be Buck Snort sodas, even though I keep my soda intake minimal, I am always down for a rootbeer or ginger beer with my Moscow Mule!\r\n \r\n3.) What is your favorite spice?\r\nI treat spices like my children. They are all great and wonderful and I love them all!\r\n\r\n4.) What Treefort experience are you looking forward to most?\r\nThis will be my first Treefort experience so I will be taking in as much as I can.\r\n ",

        "bio": "And And And is a band formed in 2009 in Portland, Oregon consisting of original members Nathan Baumgartner (vocals, guitar), Bim Ditson (drums), Berg Radin (guitar), Jonathan Sallas (bass), and Ryan Wiggans (guitar). Some of them grew up listening to YES and Pink Floyd, and some of them to Fugazi and The Clash. Their sound incorporates melodic, brutal guitars and angular rhythms. The band is comfortable diverging from that path towards delicate territory with stripped back piano-based songs and vocal harmonies. \r\nAfter releasing three self-recorded full-length albums between 2009 and 2011, a 10” E.P. and a 7” E.P. in 2012, a live album in 2013, and their first studio L.P. in 2015, they are releasing their second studio album in February, 2018. It is titled “Idiot.” Their previous album, “The Failure,” was largely a rumination on depression and disappointment. Their upcoming album continues to explore these themes with the addition of open-ended subject matter that looks at consciousness, knowledge, and the nature of reality. \r\nWhat does it mean to be conscious? How did consciousness arise? Does it exist on a spectrum? Each coherent answer we find leads to additional questions. Knowledge and awareness have led us to create beautiful things and evil things. Life and death are a package deal. The title track, “Idiot,” addresses this duality with the lyric, “if I never froze, then I’d never be warm.” The same theme is stated in “The Visitor” with “It’s bittersweet, the knowledge that everything must fall to rise again.”\r\nThere is much more going on here than we are detecting. A person can see colors a dog cannot see. A dog can hear pitches that a person cannot hear. Those colors and pitches still exist whether we can detect them or not. The album is bookended by theme, beginning with “Get Off My Lawn” which states, “Lately, I get the feeling this is all just fake,” and ending with “I’m still looking” which contains the lyric, “I’m still looking for a hole in the tapestry my senses wove within my mind.” We are bound by senses, which act as filters that deliver the minimum information required to keep us alive. We lack knowledge of the breadth of reality. A person can look at an ant and say “that ant doesn’t know anything.” Some 4th dimensional god could look at a person and say “that person doesn’t know anything,” and some 5th dimensional god says, “that god doesn’t know anything.”",

        "bio": "\"Stories are all around us, and I’m listening to people even when they think I'm not,\" states Sammy Brue.  \"If I get to the emotion of it, I can find the words.”   \r\n\r\nRealism and storytelling are qualities that are prominent on I Am Nice, the 16-year-old Utah singer-songwriter's New West debut.  The 12-song album—produced by Ben Tanner of Alabama Shakes and John Paul White of the Civil Wars—shows the young troubadour to be a timeless talent whose catchy compositions embody the sort of wisdom, empathy and insight that's usually associated with more experienced songwriters. \r\n\r\nOn such distinctive originals as \"I Know,\" \"Was I the Only One,\" \"I Never Said\" and \"Control Freak,\" Brue demonstrates a rare knack for placing himself in the shoes of others, real or fictionalized, and writing melodically inventive, emotionally resonant stories about them.  No wonder he's been hailed as an \"Americana prodigy\" by Rolling Stone and as a \"wunderkind\" by American Songwriter, as well as receiving early attention from The Wall Street Journal and The Fader, and from his local ABC TV station. \r\n\r\nSammy Brue has been writing songs since the age of 10.  After receiving an acoustic guitar from his father for Christmas, he quickly embraced the instrument and began learning the songs of Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie.  Within two months, he'd written his first original, pointedly titled \"The Woody Guthrie Song.\" \r\n\r\nDemonstrating an impressive level of drive and dedication, Sammy busked at the Sundance film festival when was just 11 years old, performed at the Newport Folk Festival, and opened shows for the likes of Hayes Carll, Lydia Loveless, John Moreland, Lukas Nelson, Lucinda Williams and Asleep at the Wheel.  He also released a trio of homespun but remarkably accomplished EPs—The Ghost of Woody Guthrie, The Bootleg Sessions and I Don't Want You to Leave—which helped to spread word of Brue's talent beyond his home state. \r\n\r\n\"The first EP,\" he explains, \"was my Woody Guthrie phase.  The second I recorded in my laundry room, and it was more like what I'm doing now.  The third was me producing it and adding kick drum and tambourine and bass—I think that's where I really found myself.\" \r\n\r\nAmong the first to champion Sammy's talents was fellow artist Justin Townes Earle, who invited him to open for him after meeting Sammy and his dad on a tour stop, and later featured him on the cover of his 2014 album Single Mothers. \r\n\r\nThe growing buzz helped Brue to win a recording deal with New West, home of such Americana icons as Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle and John Hiatt.  Recording I Am Nice in Florence, Alabama, Sammy, along with co-producers Tanner and White, gently augmented his songs with spacious, evocative arrangements that showcase the strength and substance of his lyrics and melodies. \r\n\r\nWith his first full album in hand and his first national tour in the offing, Sammy Brue is matter-of-fact about taking his next musical steps.",

        "bio": "KOLARS is a band of two members. \r\n\r\nRob Kolar sings and strums his rollicking guitar, Lauren Brown uses her whole body as a percussive instrument.  \r\n\r\nKOLARS has created a sonic world that straddles self-described genres such as Desert Disco, R&Beyond, Space Blues, and Glam-a-billy. Rob produces, mixes, and writes the material.  His studio experimentation is incorporated into the live show. Lauren has invented her own drumming style. She tap dances rhythms with her feet atop a bass drum while simultaneously playing a stand-up kit. She uses this dance to transform beats into natural extensions of her movement.\r\nThe two perform with energy, sweat, and excitement, thrilling audiences with their unabashed exuberance.  \r\n\r\nHUFFINGTON POST: \"instantly fell in love with their tantalizing sonics, and their energetic, apocalyptic marvel\" \r\n\r\nCONSEQUENCE OF SOUND:  \"Takes your heart by the hand and leads you to the dance floor, daring you to not feel motivated to dance, shimmy, just escape the mundane.\"\r\n\r\nCONAN O'BRIEN: \"Out of this world.\"\r\n\r\nDENVER POST:  \"KOLARS has a knack for buffing your weathered perspective to a glinting sheen.  The world isn’t on fire; it’s glowing.\"\r\n\r\nGRIMY GOODS:  \"IT'S A MUST LISTEN. Both upbeat, and soft and sultry when it needs to be.  You can’t help but let yourself get lost in Rob’s croons and bewitching words.\"\r\n\r\nBANDSINTOWN:  \"KOLARS is a highly experimental duo committed to creating a new sound that will thrill audiences all over the world\"  \r\n\r\n\r\nPASTE MAGAZINE:  \"KOLARS play their unique blend of 70s glam rock, 90s grunge and twangy country with every inch of their body.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTORONTO STAR: \"Rob is a pompadoured guitar pro with a throaty voice.   Lauren provides potent accessorizing to his rockabilly-punk styling, hammering away on a cocktail drum kit while tap-dancing on a customized bass drum.\"\r\n\r\nAs members of glam-folk band He's My Brother She's My Sister, Rob and Lauren toured the U.S. and Europe extensively and sold out venues in every major city across the states, playing Bonnaroo, Summerfest, Voodoo, Firefly, Secret Garden Party, and Austin City Limits, and performed on late night television (Craig Ferguson). \r\n\r\nThe band has taken their influences and experiences into a new futuristic realm with KOLARS.",

Although, puppets may be a childs' entree to the weirdness of real life, the playmakers at HomeGrown Theatre know this to be true: puppets aren’t just for kids. Enter the Horrific Puppet Affair, a cabaret of short horror puppet plays built to make your inner child squirm and scream. A punk-rock continuation of the Victorian art of Toy Theatre, the Horrific Puppet Affair tells strange stories through a wide variety of puppets, hand and rod, shadow-play, marionette, and other bizarre summations. The Horrific Puppet Affair brings a mixtape of their favorite puppet plays to Treefort Music Fest, a collection of music-forward expressions to creep and chill Treeforters.",

        "bio": "Ryan Oxford remembers being strangely drawn to the smell of the old RCA turntable in the attic of his grandparents’ duplex. There was also the deep admiration he felt watching his dad embarrass his sister with shameless air guitar solos to Bowie’s “Five Years”. Perhaps that performance inspired his own debut - at age six, dancing to “These Boots Are Made for Walking” in front of his mom’s full-length mirror with an audience he didn’t exactly know was there.\r\n\r\nFa Fa Fa Fired is a long time coming for Oxford, a testament to his determined, singular path. It’s full of twangy guitars, sassy backing vocals and the sweet hiss of reel-to-reel tape that he still can’t shake. The songs are playful, charming, melancholy and honest. They’re mostly about being dumb and in love and sometimes just about being dumb. The album was recorded with help from Dominik Schmidt and features Christian Blunda (Mean Jeans, Patsy's Rats), Nick Dewitt (Pretty Girls Make Graves), Scott Hartlaub (Jessica Lea Mayfield) and Arjan Miranda (Black Mountain, Strand of Oaks).",

Two former straight edge hardcore kids, a former California skate punk, and an \"orgcore\" devotee came together to produce Black Bolt's signature sound: mid-to-uptempo, sludgy punk songs with just a hint of 90s college rock. Black Bolt aren't the fastest or most extreme band in the Boise punk scene. They're not the most intricate, technically polished, or melodic, either. \r\n\r\nThey play songs for the underdogs of the flyover states-- the people who feel stifled by the high desert's draconian politics, the weirdos who feel uncomfortable with civilized society, and the marginalized people who find refuge in loud, snotty garage punk. Black Bolt are equal parts party and political, equal parts poetry and bathroom wall engravings. Now well into their 30s, and with no illusions of making punk rock into a career, Black Bolt see playing music as a way to celebrate and commune with old friends, new friends, and future friends alike.",

Destiny is an up and coming, multifaceted, DIY artist from the New York City underground. Her unique musical style blends tribal beats with trip hop and R&B - creating an exciting and unprecedented crossover of sounds. Her first independent album in 2014, “Metallic Butterfly,” combines a post-Internet era view on cyber-feminism, a metaphysical awareness of nature, and sex and drugs; often stepping into a dystopian, or indigenous landscape. Her songs are both hypnotic and hyper-reality driven. Vice Magazine hailed the album as being “...one of the most exciting and ambitious [albums] to come out of the NYC underground in a long time…” Aside from her music, Destiny also hosts a weekly web-based radio show that she DJs as part of her feminist art collective, Smart Girls Club, helping to open up dialogue and support for young women of all ethnicities in music and the arts.",

        "bio": "Jonathan and Michael Rosen are brothers, and also Cones. Growing up in San Francisco, they were as close as could be – spending their free time eating cereal.\r\n\r\nJonathan was infatuated with pop music from day one. He cried when he realized Elvis was dead. He would build cardboard drum sets in his room and play along to the Bee Gees. In contrast, Michael had a technical and academic approach to music. Trained in piano and composition, he studied in the classical tradition, writing his first opera at the age of 16.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers are based in Los Angeles. Jonathan is an acclaimed hand-drawn animator. He has created music videos for such artists as Toro y Moi, Eleanor Friedberger, and Delicate Steve. His rock and roll dream was born on the set of HBO’s Vinyl, when he played the role of Johnny Thunders. Michael is a commercial/film composer and experimental sound artist. His fiercely technical brain works in collaboration with his heightened ear to create beautiful and strange sonic environments.\r\n\r\nPrior to starting Cones, the brothers played in the backing band for Eleanor Friedberger (of the Fiery Furnaces), helping to write and tour on her latest record New View. While on tour, Jonathan and Michael conceptualized a new project. One that would fuse Jonathan’s pop sensibilities with Michael’s lush soundscapes and key-heavy orchestration. One that would rely on an entire lifetime of brotherhood – sounds that Jonathan could draw and images that Michael could hear.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2017, Cones released a music video (animated by Jonathan) for their debut single ‘Echoes On’ via The Fader. Two more singles titled ‘Back in the Brain’ and ‘Whatever You’re Into’ will be released in August 2017 via Canvasclub, Canvasback Music’s monthly singles series.",

She has performed, exhibited, and curated around the world since 2002, exploring the politics of gender, race, motherhood, identity and the construct of the Canadian landscape in the Latin American diaspora and vernacular.\r\n\r\nLido's latest LP La Papessa (2016), charts an evolution from her debut LP Color (2010), an album full of (as the title suggests) colorful landscapes and positive vibrations. The 2017 Polaris Prize-nominated album, La Papessa, takes a more personal approach, describing the narrative of how Lido has found her independence as a woman and as an artist who refuses to fit pre-conceived notions of what a pop Latina artist ought to be.\r\n\r\nThe album was written in multiple cultural and geographic settings -- the desert of Indigenous Wayuu land and the northern mountains in Colombia, as well as in Canada, in both London and Toronto, Ontario -- and the music, in turn, reflects these settings. The sounds on La Papessa take listeners on a musical journey from traditional Afro-Colombian percussion to global bass and darker avant-garde electronic sounds. Lido's piercing, explosive and heartwarming voice unites the compositions, beats and harmonies, resulting in a perfect labour of love and sound that highlights the creative voice of this talented artist.",

Between the five members they cover the banjo, acoustic and electric guitar, electric and upright bass, piano, organ, drums, mandolin, harmonica, accordion, fiddle, jaw harp, lap steel and dobro. During Grizzly’s live shows it is rare that an instrument is played by the same person for more than two songs consecutively.\r\n \r\nGrizzly Goat’s show is highly energetic and compelling. From stomp and hollering banjo rockers that give punk-rock a good run for its money to genuine ballads performed as intimately as if by a campfire, the band leads any audience on a journey through Americana.\r\n \r\nGrizzly Goat is hardworking and tireless. In three years, they’ve released two full length CD’s of original material, one EP, played festivals, bars, picnics, BBQ joints, after-parties, casinos, and front porches across the country from California to South Carolina.",

        "bio": "Tino Drima is a cauldron of then, now, and what will be. There is grease, there is friction, there is high harmony, there are ripping beats, there are charmed humans parading onstage and in studio. There is a radio playing on the other side of the wall and Old Man Cooper has not left his apartment in over a month and it stinks. But this music does not, this music exudes class and classicism, and lifts you up and places you smack dab in the middle of newly decorated living room filled with Hummel figurines, a comfy couch, and the sound of dishes clinking and clanking in the kitchen sink just past the dining room. You want to stay, and you want to listen to the music, and you want to hang out, and you will stay up for as long as it lasts and maybe even longer, because it sounds so good and it smells like bacon over in that room now. \r\n\r\nTino Drima consists of Gregory DiMartino, Rob Mills, Mackenzie Bunch, Henry Baker, and Scott Huerta. Their names sound oddly like items of food. \r\n\r\nLike most of us, they are fascinated by metadata. That is why the music they perform has been called Psyche Doo-Wop Hell Croon. It is a genre they respect, that they have pioneered, that will only get bigger and broader with time. Sort of like people.",

Attendees will leave this panel with a greater understanding of the music supervision process and factors that make a song a good candidate for licensing. \r\n\r\nThis panel will feature lots of audience interaction and Q&A, so attendees will be able to ask the questions they've always had about music supervision.",

His mother took him to visit numerous spiritual teachers, who inspired him on the spiritual path he walks today. As a teenager, he became a hip hop fanatic.\r\nHis rooted interest in hip hop led him to learning the art of scratching — using turntables as musical instruments. Sol Rising soon became one of America’s top scratch DJs, winning second place at the DMC, the world’s most prestigious DJ competition.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating in the top 5% of his accounting class at University of Iowa, he realized accounting was not his path. A journey to India illuminated his true calling — to light up people’s awareness of their true nature through music. This lead him to study audio engineering and production at Pyramind Studios in San Francisco and produce his first album, \"I AM Soul.\"\r\n\r\nNow a successful Producer/DJ, with over 6 albums released, Sol Rising plays major events across the world, including Wanderlust Yoga Festival, Burning Man, Symbiosis and Lightning in a Bottle. He has opened for major acts such as Steel Pulse, and produced official remixes for artists including Jai Uttal, Wildlight, Mochipet, David Starfire, Delhi 2 Dublin, Kirtaniyas, and more. He has also joined forces with Yoga powerhouse MC Yogi and has a fervent following in the global Ecstatic Dance scene. Sol Rising has been featured in major media outlets including the Yoga Journal, Washington Post, and his music has been enjoyed by over one million viewers in a viral YouTube video.",

They journeyed to the Basque Country in the summer of 1960 in pursuit of this dream. In the midst of the mountains and sea coast where the Basque culture began, the young people met a group of dancers from the town of Donostia (or San Sebastian). The Oinkari's made their debut at the annual gathering of area Basques, the Sheepherder's Ball, at Christmas time in 1960. The dream at last came true. The hard work continues; the dream has blossomed and the Oinkari Dancers have become a source of pride to the Basque community as well as to the State of Idaho. In the best tradition of folk customs, the dances have been taught to hundreds of young Basques throughout the years.",

        "bio": "Immortal Bird is an American blackened death metal band from Chicago, Illinois. Their music is also influenced by grindcore, progressive metal, and post-metal. Lyrically, they cover themes of mental illness, grief, abuse, and delve into philosophical and psychological concepts. The band was formed in 2013 with the intention of being a recording project, but has evolved into an actively touring and collaborative group. As of November 2017, the band has toured North America and Europe with a genre-bending mix of upcoming and established groups.\r\n\r\nImmortal Bird was formed in early 2013 by drummer/vocalist and Berklee College of Music graduate Rae Amitay (formerly of JUNO-winning metal band Woods of Ypres and Polaris Prize nominated Mares of Thrace) as a writing project between herself and another guitarist/arranger. Following the addition of bassist John Picillo, the band recorded their debut EP, \"Akrasia\" at Lo-Tech Laboratories where it was then mixed by Kurt Ballou (Converge). The EP was released on December 3, 2013 and debuted on the Decibel Magazine website to critical acclaim, calling it \"dark and twisting, Akrasia refuses to be pigeonholed. Often proggy, sometimes doomy, and other times quite beautiful, it offers surprises around every sudden corner.\"\r\n\r\nIn 2015, the band recorded their full-length debut, \"Empress/Abscess,\" in February 2015 with Pete Grossmann at Bricktop Recording Studio where it was then mixed and mastered by Colin Marston (Gorguts, Krallice). The album's track \"Saprophyte\" was premiered by NPR and hailed as \"find[ing] the sweet spot between guitarist Kurt Ballou's menacing melodies for Converge, The Dillinger Escape Plan's battle-ready tech-metal, and Carcass' unrelenting (and often catchy) death-metal-spiked grindcore.\"\r\n\r\nHaving completed a two-week European tour in November 2017, the band is actively writing new material for their second full-length, due late next year.",

Known for delivering unflinchingly energetic live performances, Bri, Derek, TJ and Michael play music that colors between the lines to delight and leave the audience in a childlike state of wonder. \r\n\r\n\"the first half of the album leaves me with a warm, refreshing nostalgia that I am not accustomed to finding with instrumental and/or post-rock artists, who often tend toward more serious, cinematic soundscapes...There is also a sense of lawlessness at play here, as if the band are making up the rules as they go. This results in strange but enticing juxtapositions of ideas like what you hear on “Ginger Dime,” which sounds like very early Explosions in the Sky set against a funk-fueled bassline...It’s enjoyably disarming for anyone who has spent an inordinate amount of time listening to music and found themselves tiring of formula.\"\r\n- Daydream Sparkle Party, Arctic Drones, 2016\r\n\r\n\"What strikes me about the band’s sound is their sheer willingness to traverse (sub)genres. Some songs, such as “Piratelike Reflexes,” have a late-90s indie-punk vibe, not unlike Braid or “Acrobatic Tenement”-era At the Drive In. Yet, two songs later, “Harlequin” takes you on a relaxing 11-minute journey that begins with a traditional post-rock structure, before morphing into an extended passage of experimental noise/ambient. Later on, you encounter “Q’s and A’s,” which is more free-wheeling up-tempo rock. It’s all over the map, and initially this is a very good thing, keeping the listener on their toes and never allowing one to settle into any concrete expectations for the songs to come.\"\r\n- Daydream Sparkle Party, Arctic Drones, 2016\r\n\r\n\"The guitar work is the most dominant force on the album. Often one guitar is providing the atmosphere with a clean, open tone, while the other is ripping in-your-face distorted riffs. This dichotomy is at times a little strange, but I think it plays well into Childspeak’s unique style. It reminds me a bit of early 2000’s alternative bands like Lost Ocean, All The Day Holiday, and The Mercury Program.\"\r\n- Daydream Sparkle Party, Sputnik Music, 2017\r\n\r\n\"I would describe Day Dream Sparkle Party in 3 words: Ambitious, Huge, and Long-Winded. For a debut record, they truly set out to show you that they won’t be boxed in by a specific genre. Most tracks (intentionally or unintentionally) remind me of Explosions in the Sky and The Appleseed Cast. But the band proves they aren’t a post-rock-one-trick pony\"\r\n- Daydream Sparkle Party, Sputnik Music, 2017",

Her debuts EP, “Postcards,” can leave one to only assume that she holds a prosperous future for a budding talent. \r\n\r\nStarting as a quiet Boise Rock School student playing background keyboard, Ali has blossomed into an accomplished singer-songwriter with an enchanting voice.

        "bio": "If you've ever wondered what a steel cut, blackened and peppered, rock-hopped hip-dipped cock-eyed funk-trunked, flat-on-your-back pants-off-dance-off machine sounds like, look no further.\r\n\r\nLounge on Fire is an independent alternative rock band formed in Boise, Idaho in 2013. Often described as \"sexadelic freak funk\", the sound draws on an eclectic blend of influences that spastically blur the lines between rock, soul, jazz, latin, disco, hip hop, and funk. Rapid and percussive vocals often combine with dark, seductive grooves and a boisterous fanfare of horns to create a unique fusion that fans of Modest Mouse, Gogol Bordello, and Cake would enjoy. The seven-piece group consists of Nathan Norton on guitar and vocals, Josh Gilmore on bass guitar, Wade Ronsse on drums, Alan Schwaderer on keyboards and guitar, Matt Patterson on saxophone, Seth Hoffman on trumpet, and Kevan Ash on trombone.  Lounge on Fire has been noted for their energetic live performances, often featuring a synchronized wardrobe that situationally varies from 70's disco-funk to prom night attire to Christmas costumes, signature dance moves that encourage audience gyration, and the horn section running into the crowd to give an intimate experience to showgoers.\r\n\r\nEarly in 2017, Lounge on Fire independently released their debut album \"Lips of Calypso\" on CD and psychedelically splattered white-and-oxblood vinyl.  Pheromones and sweat dripped from the ceiling as the release show became the only local show in recent memory to sell out the Nuerolux in Boise, Idaho - a 300-capacity venue, and many were turned away from the door. The album was recorded and produced by Jason Ringelstetter at Tonic Room Studios in Boise, Idaho. While each track stands alone, evolving from rock'n'roll cabaret to soulful ballad to dance-funk and back again, \"Lips of Calypso\" is a concept album; an ode to the human body as a hostage to the temptation of sin, particularly that of lust. Each track embodies the perspective of the \"sinner\" and their struggle with the burden created by this seduction.  In Lips of Calypso, gratification is met with indignity in the journey of grappling with desire in attempt to be released from the prison of the flesh.",

        "bio": "Cutting vocals in the woods behind his college dorm. Mixing in the backseat of a sedan. Sneaking into the music department after hours to teach himself to play new instruments (and sneaking out before the faculty arrived in the morning). From the start, Mobley's work has been marked by solitude, ingenuity, and a drive that could only be called obsessive. Whether you experience him on record or at one of his incredible concerts, the passion is palpable in every aspect. He writes, performs, & produces his music, designs his artwork, directs his videos, produces his multimedia live shows, and even builds new instruments to carry out his vision.\r\n\r\nOver the past couple years, he's composed dozens of pieces for stage and television (with placements on HBO, Fox, and NBC), played 200+ national tour dates (with the likes of Phantogram, JUNGLE, Mutemath, Robert Delong, & Wavves and at festivals like ACL, SXSW, CMJ, Savannah Stopover and Float Fest), and recorded (then scrapped) two whole albums in pursuit of the songs that would become his forthcoming full-length debut, Fresh Lies. The music -- which Mobley calls \"post-genre pop\" -- defies easy classification, drawing liberally (often simultaneously) from an array of musical traditions. He's equally at home on a playlist next to The Weeknd and TV on the Radio alike, while his electronic, dub-dabbling production style calls to mind the intricate work of artists like James Blake and Thom Yorke.\r\n\r\nThis summer and fall, he's touring as a one-man band, singing and playing keys, guitar, bass, drums, and samplers. He's spanning the United States and Mexico in support of his newest EP release, Some Other Country, out now on Violent Films.",

Edison is known for their dedication to building a substantial national fan base thanks to their high-energy live shows and tireless touring efforts. In addition to countless club gigs, they've earned attention at such music industry conferences as SXSW, CMJ Music Marathon and Folk Alliance International. \"We've been on the road nonstop for over a year\", Slaton notes. \"We didn't have a lot of releases out there so we decided to hit the road and meet as many people as we could and foster those relationships.\" That strategy worked, winning the band a devoted national support slots with the likes of Iron & Wine, Andrew McMahon In The Wilderness,  Langhorne Slim and Nathaniel Rateliff & The Nightsweats. Edison released their debut LP \"Familiar Spirit\" after signing with Rhyme & Reason Records in 2016. \r\n\r\n\"Though it’s a proper studio release, the nine-track effort in a way captures exactly what the band’s been doing the last 12 months: bringing music to life.\" - Consequence of Sound",

The project is a bipartisan effort aimed at developing concrete solutions to address digital vulnerabilities in both campaigns, and state\r\nand local election processes. For the state and local election line of effort, the D3P team has spent the last several months conducting field observations at the state, local and individual polling site level to gather information about the varying election processes, their corresponding security vulnerabilities, and other election specific considerations. In the coming days, D3P will be releasing a publicly available “playbook” that provides cybersecurity solutions and best practices to help close or mitigate digital security gaps. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in late-March, D3P will be hosting a conference for all 50 states, to teach election officials how to conduct cyber-related table top exercises and how to increase their own cybersecurity awareness and\r\npreparedness. Additional lines of effort include a campaign cyber security guide, a communications guide, and a state communications template. The discussion will center around what’s at stake when it comes to protecting our elections and our democracy and the ten best practices that apply to all election jurisdictions.",

Their most recent release, an EP entitled Phone Home, showcases a darker, moodier side of the band than that found on their debut LP, Get Lost. Written and arranged after a rather turbulent time in their lives (your late twenties can be ROUGH), even the cheerful sounding single, 'Life Is But A Dream' harbors sinister intentions. Since the release of 'Phone Home' Genders have completed a west coast tour supporting experimental wizards The Helio Sequence, played several dates with indie rock legends/face melters Built To Spill, headlined their own west coast tour, and wrapped up tracking on their second LP which will see release in 2018.",

        "bio": "Give Twin Peaks an inch and they’ll take a stretch of the road. Having careened across America and beyond, sharing their staggering energy, the band made their third album the best way they know how: by themselves. The same group that produced the scuzzy squalor of their debut “Sunken,” had legions of fans screaming along to their anthemic sophomore effort, “Wild Onion,” now swings and serenades with “Down In Heaven” (out on Grand Jury on May 13th).\r\n \r\nCo-produced by the band and longtime collaborator R. Andrew Humphrey, and mixed by new confidant John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile, Sonic Youth), the record is by turns raw, polished and wise beyond its years. The diverse new songs beg the listener to sway slowly, bang their head wildly and question what they were doing wasting emotional time on anything less. It is a marked, and some may say mature, development for a band that doesn’t know how to play it safe. They aren’t here to tell you what youth is like or what being a little older now means, though; they want to join you in a conversation about why we hurt, love and tug at each other.\r\n \r\nWhile Twin Peaks is a bit older, they’re not necessarily calmer; their restlessness endures. Born of Chicago’s league-leading DIY scene and with several of them remaining friends since elementary school, Cadien Lake James, Clay Frankel, Connor Brodner, Jack Dolan, and most recent addition Colin Croom share an enthusiasm, authenticity and passion their audiences have found contagious. In the three years since dropping out of college to support their debut album “Sunken,” the band has covered a lot of ground. They’ve played to ever-increasing crowds, bigger and rowdier each time they come barreling into a city; they were anointed “Best New Band” by NME and countless other blogs, and they have performed for (and partied with) more than hospitable masses at festivals in the states and Europe, including Pitchfork, Lollapalooza, Reading & Leeds, and Roskilde. In between all this action, the group set up camp in the summer of 2015 amidst the solitude of a murky lake in Western Massachusetts, where they could experiment and record on their own terms in the warm living room of a good friend’s house.\r\n \r\n“Down in Heaven” will bring old fans and new Twin Peaks most complex record to date, encompassing elements only teased on their previous efforts. Frankel says, “I don’t know yet what kind of band we are, since we keep changing with every year. I guess we are a band unafraid of new influences and changes.” Put simply, “Down In Heaven” makes it increasingly hard to call their sound “classic.” It’s rock new and old, it’s a little bit of country, it’s a whole lot of punk attitude, and it’s something to get excited about. Twin Peaks is here to stay, and they aren’t going to get pinned down.",

        "bio": "Battlehooch is the kind of band you thought went extinct with landline phones & cassette tapes. In one sense they’re a band from another, sturdier era: a band that releases consistently quality material on a consistent basis, a band that doesn’t sacrifice creative drive for commercial interest, a band that grows and evolves with each successive release. From the beautiful madcap mess of debut LP Piecechow to the more refined yet still quite zany jams on Hot Lungs to a cool, polished psych-rock sheen on 2014’s Wink EP, Battlehooch has proven itself as a band built to last. They may possess an old-school mindset, but their music is weird & diverse enough to fit into this wild new century.\r\n\r\nFormed in San Francisco, the birthplace of psychedelia, it’s fitting that the six-piece collective echoes the city’s tie-dyed past in its own compositions. However, the group isn’t content with becoming a mere tribute to a time period they never lived through. Instead, Battlehooch updates the sound of psychedelia for a new generation, one that can now access dozens of genres & millions of songs with a few clicks on their iPhones. Battlehooch reflects this modern trend of manic music consumption: on any of their many releases, the listener will be treated to a sonic smorgasbord, bouncing from hard rock to dance-pop to cartoony head trips to flirtations with electronica & jazz & Afrobeat & everything else in between within the span of a few minutes, sometimes even seconds.",

Though their inspirations are many, George Washing Machine’s music has been compared to The Flaming Lips, early Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Mr. Bungle. At every show audiences are left in awe of George Washing Machine’s intensity and infectious excitement on stage.",

A few months later, the band finished recording its debut EP \"As the Sun Went Down\". The release's mix of yearning introspection and surging power got an immediate response. \r\n\r\nIn 2017 the band signed with Massachusetts based independent label Take This To Heart Records to release their debut full length, \"Driftwood Songs\". The album's ability to balance sophisticated arrangements with careening energy shows how quickly the band's songwriting has grown.",

        "bio": "The Brankas are an experimental punk duo from San Francisco, CA. The band was formed in 2014 by Theo Slavin (guitar & vocals) and Taylor McElroy (drums & synthesizer) and they have since fine-tuned an asymmetrical style focused around start/stop dynamics, odd time signatures, and off kilter pop. Their ensuing records (2016’s Exchanges EP & Identical Tentacles EP and 2017’s “My Parkour Body…”) would certainly be at home with fans of The Locust & Tera Melos, as well as in collections featuring Black Moth Super Rainbow or Deerhoof. \r\n\r\nTheir latest full length, “My Parkour Body Is The Paint And The World Is My Canvas. I Don't See Obstacles, I See Opportunities.” is “…beautifully unhinged and cohesively clashes with itself in precisely the ways The Brankas intended… each member of the San Francisco two piece’s stellar musicianship is as noticeable as the songwriting prowess that is evident in their previous releases.” (Spencer Kilpatrick, Tahoe Onstage, 2017). \r\nThe album sees the two friends finding meaning in chaos on an intentionally broken record. “All ten tracks are dedicated to sometimes electronic, sometimes just electric, and sometimes... borderline disturbing methods of experimentation. These two are here to surprise you…” (Allie Miller, The Deli SF, 2017).\r\n\r\n“My Parkour Body…” is available on vinyl, cassette and digital via thebrankas.bandcamp.com or online via Spotify & other major streaming services.",

        "bio": "Cassiopeia was born of a deep foray into the dream world, flying over childhood fantasies, sitting with smashed dreams, sifting through rubble in the wake of change, and staring into the eyes of loves lost. As an avid dream wanderer, Hannah Skelton often harnesses these psychedelic altered states which are natural to the human body.  She goes into the other worlds to forage for feelings, chasing after things that invigorate and terrify us; peering into corners of reality that we often don’t want to acknowledge, steeping in the flavors that are found there - the highs and lows that are ever present in our fumble through existence - grappling with them and pulling them out of the subconscious and into the morning. Her quivering, emotional melodies all too well embody the underlying pain of her melancholy themes.\r\n\r\nJohn Battaglia paints a beautiful landscape with his guitar that is heartfelt, ambient, and often summoning an interstellar quality. Once shrouded in droning organ, a cosmic, goth rock emerges, anchored by Brian Gorman's (Tartufi / Rock Band Land) swirling, ever changing and thoughtfully placed rhythms.",

        "bio": "\"A TRIAL OF OUR STRENGTH, A TESTAMENT TO OUR ANGER.” - This is the epitome of ENDORPHINS LOST, a fierce and manic power violence outfit based out of the Pacific Northwest. The band has constantly evolved since its conception in 2009, increasing in speed and intensity while amplifying its rudimentary overtone of misanthropy and the inherent dysfunction of mankind.\r\nThe debut release “BLOOD PACT” (2013 - WHAT’S LEFT/BAD PEOPLE/NUCLEAR ASS RECORDS) was a steamroller of crusty grindcore mixed with pummeling d-beat. \"BLOOD PACT\" was immediately followed by a split seven inch with Indonesia’s TERSANJUNG 13 (2013 - self released) which was supported by a lengthy southeast Asia tour in 2013/2014. The band then released a split seven with grind violence maniacs from South bend Indiana FLVX CAPACITOR (2014 - ROTTEN TO THE CORE RECORDS) and toured the West Coast/Mexico in 2015. After drafting new personnel the band is in top form, releasing its most relentless display of audio violence to date - a split seven inch with San Jose Riff merchants DEATHGRAVE (2016 - ROTTEN TO THE CORE RECORDS).\r\nThey followed this release with an extensive U.S. tour and are at last, releasing their first full length titled “CHOOSE YOUR WAY”. This upcoming album will be released by the legendary SIX WEEKS RECORDS is hitting turntables in November 2016. \"CHOOSE YOUR WAY\" showcases the band’s new lineup, a combination of primal power violence and of metallic hardcore punk. This incendiary contribution is the sign of things to come, with new music and tours in the works, there seems to be no stopping the inevitable. As the seven plagues are a sign of the apocalypse, ENDORPHINS LOST is the sound of end times.",

        "bio": "New Move, led by Portland native Jesse Bettis, produces modern pop gems full of nods to pops past. In 2016, the band signed to Bug Hunt(Tender Loving Empire imprint), who released their eponymous debut LP. The LP proved to be a perfect vehicle for the band to explore their take on classic pop, while Bettis was honing his idea of the perfect song. On the record you’ll hear the band digging in, turning old tropes on their head, with new energy and overall pulling off a slick, hook-laden album.\r\n\r\nThe first single, “The City Life”, caught the ear of Eric Davidson at CMJ, who described the pulsing, anthemic ode to the grind of daily life, \"Like if early Todd Rundgren was a disgruntled intern at Playstation’s soundlab, dreaming of fun in the sun somewhere.\" Furthermore, the record cemented New Move's reputation in Portland as a band to watch, with a growing fanbase and a loyal following.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Bettis made a substantial pivot toward collaboration by producing New Move II: Back In The Habit. The record is a track by track re-production of New Move’s 2016 self-titled debut. The difference from the debut lies in its secret: alchemy. Teaming up with other artists, Bettis let them guide the creative process, re-interpreting the songwriting as their own and the results were indeed magical.\r\n\r\nFrom Portland magazine, Willamette Week: “Bettis doesn’t just feature local talent on his songs, he allows them to make the songs theirs. Y La Bamba takes ‘When Did We Stop’ from plinky, optimistic doo-wop to sweeping, horn-topped Latin euphoria, while Chanti Darling totally reinvents straight-ahead rock ballad ‘The City Life’ with clubby R&B sex appeal. Radiation City’s take on ‘No One But Her’ could be easily mistaken for the last-ever Rad City song, with muted, loungey percussion and saxophone and thickly stacked harmonies relishing the runs between notes...It’s a manifesto on the unshakable virtues of classic pop, and it is solidly convincing.”\r\n\r\nBack in the Habit marked a turn in New Move's relationship with the Portland music scene. Allowing the space for others input has become an essential element of creativity for Bettis and New Move.\r\n\r\nAs we speak, Bettis is already producing an upcoming compilation of Portland bands. The comp is being put together more like an album than a typical compilation, with all the bands recording new material. Bettis will take the creative helm in the studio as producer of the entire project. Nearly all of the featured bands have collaborated with Misplaced Screen Printing, a local design company who will creating visuals for the record.\r\n\r\n“This compilation is the next step in our evolution. We wanted to curate an album of our friends songs, which felt more  cohesive than the average comp.  It just so happens  get their merch made through Misplaced, so the partnership just made sense.”\r\n\r\nThe band is also currently writing their next record and producing a series of comedy videos. Keep your eyes and ears peeled.",

        "bio": "Growing up in both New York and Miami, Michna (real name: Adrian Yin Michna) is that unique breed of artist that draws from both the urban and the tropical. As a youngster, Adrian started DJing parties with cassettes and playing trombone in a band on the NYC bar circuit including the infamous Lions Den and CBGBs.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to Miami in the mid-90s, he co-founded the pioneering Secret Frequency Crew, who deftly mixed instrumental hip-hop and electronic into a coherent whole. Adrian later found his stride as a solo artist by bringing together his myriad influences into a succinct sonic persona. In 2007, he flew to Brazil to work with Diplo and Bonde Do Role producing the song Quero Te Amar. A year later, he signed to Ghostly International to release his debut LP Magic Monday. It was the producers tightly woven musical amalgam of hip-hop, booty, electro and detailed process that made Magic Monday move.\r\n\r\nAdrian followed up his debut with 2009 EP, Eggstra, which leaned more towards a heady mix of hip-hop beats and breakbeat. In 2012,\r\n\r\nhe took a great leap forward in terms of both songwriting and production with a more futuristic house meets hip-hop nod on the Moving Mountains EP. From there he produced beats for the release of Nikes Lebron XII shoe, as well as the video game Hohokum, and had an extended portion of his track Swiss Glide selected by Mike Judge for an episode of Silicon Valley.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Adrian returned with his second full-length album, Thousand Thursday, an effort that streamlined his life and cultural background into vibrant, affable dancefloor sounds. He has since toured the world, collaborated at MoMA with sound artist Yuri Suzuki, and in 2017 composed new audio for a one-night only show with Bec Brittain.\r\n\r\nCurrently based in Brooklyn, Adrian Michna has become a staple in the NYC club scene, known for his chameleon like abilities. He has also DJ’d for Bergdorf Goodman, Opening Ceremony, Kenzo, The Warhol Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Richard Branson, Jack Ma, and many, many more. Outside of the club, hes been able to pursue interests such as painting, bicycles, and video art.",

While the band is most certainly from Idaho, much of the music of their late-2015 release Totems is full of grizzly psychedelic Southern rock licks. It’s music that speaks to your soul while also slapping you in the face.”\r\n--- The Inlander",

        "bio": "Cavegreen is the collaboration between Eleanor Murray and GianLuca Bucci, creating electro-pop original music that combines earthly drum and dance beats with light, dreamy melodies, a soundscape that is both grounded and ethereal. The songs sing about the profound human connectivity to the elements of nature, inspired by ancient philosophical traditions. Their new album, Vita Lucida, is one to dance with, dream beside, and ponder with. \r\n\r\nEleanor has been a musician, songwriter, and performer for the past eleven years, releasing five studio albums and touring the US extensively.  Gianluca comes from a background of environmental work, photography, and an ongoing interest in the ancient and modern philosophical traditions of the earth. In 2015, Cavegreen released their debut EP, Journey of Return and began performing shows and creating music videos around the Pacific Northwest.  Their newest album, Vita Lucida, released February 2017.\r\n\r\n“Cavegreen is an exercise in the weirdest and most wonderful pop imaginable. For fans of left-field artists such as Purity Ring and Aurora, Cavegreen's music will hit a wonderful sweet spot - engaging and listenable, yet utterly original.”  - The Line of Best Fit\r\n\r\n\"Cavegreen have proven to be some of the most creative and immaculate songs to come out of the ever-fertile Olympia music scene in recent years.” - Northwest Music Scene\r\n\r\n\"Stomping toms, dense synths, heavily reverbed guitar squalls, and feathery female vocals drop this piece into a triangle between synth-pop, folk-pop, and earthy new-age work. It’s an impressive, unique sound.” - Independent Clauses\r\n\r\n“Witches Dream” is a breathtaking number that must be experienced with your eyes close. The warm, ambient production by Eleanor Murray and GianLuca Bucci are lush, immersive, and ethereal, feeling like a dream is occurring in front of us.” - The Revue\r\n\r\n\"Vita Lucida sees Cavegreen lead you by the hand into their mossy, electro-natural world, opening your eyes to every tiny wonder surrounding you.\" - The Line of Best Fit (album review)",

Me, Again, the follow up to his debut Control, taps into his sense of vulnerability, taking on themes of isolation, addiction, and regret. The album is a jagged collection of garage rock and soft DIY indie and noisey pop music, channeling everyone from Ty Segall to Elliot Smith to Deerhunter.",

Featuring a mix of covers with seamlessly blended original material, the band has worked up musically captivating and upbeat sets of dance music with soulful ballads peppered in between. \r\n\r\nAt the center of the group is bassist and vocalist Birch Pereira, who's vocal sound has been described as a cross between Ricky Nelson and Chris Isaak. Serving as the songwriter, bandleader and arranger, he is joined by a talented array of musicians who make up the Gin Joints (most often featuring Jason Goessl on guitar, Adrian Van Batenburg on drums, Steve Tressler on saxophone/clarinet, Ray Larsen on trumpet along with Jimmie Herrod and Kate Voss on supporting vocals).\r\n\r\nThe band has received great acclaim in the Pacific Northwest for their self-produced debut album “Dream Man.” It won the Earshot Jazz Recording of the Year award in 2016 and receives repeated airplay on Seattle’s jazz and Americana stations KNKX and KBCS. The band travels often as a trio (bass/vocals, electric guitar & drums) doing mini-tours throughout the Northwest and flying out to New Orleans and New York City. For larger festival gigs (like the Upstream Music Festival, the Northwest’s answer to SXSW) the expanded lineup is featured with added horn players and background singers.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for the bands second record, coming out in March 2018 entitled “Western Soul.”",

        "bio": "A native of Southern California, Joshua McCaslin formed Roselit Bone in Portland, Oregon in 2013: first as a duo with drummer Ben Dahmes, then a trio, and eventually a 9-piece ensemble of flute, trumpets, pedal steel, violin and more. Josh himself is a triple threat: a versatile and accomplished guitarist, a powerful writer of vivid nightmare-poetry, and a singer unique in his ability to croon like Marty Robbins, bellow like Nick Cave, and scream, grunt and wail like a defiant, wounded animal.\r\n\r\nIf 2014’s self-released debut Blacken & Curl set the tone, 2016's BLISTER STEEL refines and expands it. Josh’s lyrics are crueler and darker, the arrangements bigger and more ambitious, the vision and scope blown up into a panoramic, foreboding landscape that looks disturbingly familiar. The grandeur of Mexican ranchera and the innocence of Hollywood’s singing cowboys belie a savage, dystopian take on hot-rod rockabilly, surf music, Tex-Mex, and post-punk. The ten-piece band moves deftly from seething minimalism, to lush countrypolitan walls of sound, to unhinged noise.",

Singh has been featured in various comedy festivals including the Chicago Comedy Exposition ('16), the Bridgetown Comedy Festival ('17), and the Limestone Comedy Festival ('17), and was a semifinalist for the Standup NBC competition ('17). Singh can be seen on Netflix in the current season of the original series Easy cabbing around a semi-fictionalized Chicago. In real Chicago, Singh runs Monkey Wrench, a monthly comedy show that is little more than a leftist plot against the ruling class.",

Down South in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Christine had been known to exercise her theatrical roots at the the local karaoke bars - and to great effect. The first time Orenda saw Christine sing at Sheffield’s Old Town Tavern her jaw dropped as she watched her sister bring the house down. After a few years in Omaha, Orenda noticed that Christine brought the house down no matter where she was singing- with people of all ages and walks of life lining up to buy her drinks and even give her requests to sing their favorite soul songs. But Christine was depressed, feeling aimless, shuffling between minimum wage jobs, and the thrill of the weekend performances wore off quickly. One night, the two began to talk about the future, and Orenda insisted that Christine should try and do what makes her happiest- perform for people. After much discussion, they decided to start High Up, a collaboration mixing elements of indie, punk and soul that showcased Christine’s powerful vocals and Orenda’s seasoned songwriting. The band, which includes Josh Soto, Todd Fink (The Faint) and Matt Focht (Head of Femur, Bright Eyes) draws from a wide variety of influences- from Janis Joplin, (who Christine is frequently compared to at live shows by misty-eyed ex-hippies), Sam Cooke, and Screaming Jay Hawkins to Dead Kennedys and The Birthday Party. Their debut record, “You Are Here” was produced by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, First Aid Kit, Monsters of Folk) at ARC Studios in Omaha, Nebraska.",

Both long time Nashville singer-songwriters, the two met in 2011 during a late night session at James' home studio and bonded over shared love of Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western soundtracks. They recorded their debut album, The Ghost of Escondido, in a single day and released it on their own label, Kill Canyon, in 2013 to critical acclaim. “We wanted it to be like Clint Eastwood playing pop songs at one of the honky-tonks downtown,” James mused. The duo's David Lynch approved sound became the soundtrack to multiple films and TV shows including HBO's Girls and led to appearances on CONAN and ABC's Nashville. The band toured extensively with the likes of Lord Huron, The Lone Bellow, and The Staves before releasing their sophomore album, Walking With A Stranger, in 2016. Following their first national headlining tours, Maros relocated to Los Angeles where the pair recently recorded their 3rd album, Warning Bells, with producer Rob Schnapf (Elliott Smith, Kurl Vile, Beck). The first single, Darkness, is out now.",

Few were chosen to lead this culture and the ones that did contained it’s spirit in 4 physical elements: DJ’s – Emcees – B-Boys/B-Girls – Graffiti and the fifth element that hold them all together, knowledge.  This culture was referred to as Hip Hop. Through the generations the spirit of Hip Hop was passed like a torch to many, some carried it with pride while others used it for foolish and selfish gain. Those that chose the righteous path have lived in the shadows, guiding the spirit through the ages teaching the starving misguided youth the ways of Hip Hop. Now one Emcee emerges from the smoke to bring the fire and passion of the originators back to the culture, his name is Axiom Tha Wyze. This Boise Idaho native has learned from the masters and strives to perfect his craft to bring you the raw rugged style of the legends before him and uplift his generation for the sake of peace, love unity and having fun.",

The album internalizes loss, addiction, abandonment and wrings them through distorted power chords, powerful leads, sheets of drone to create building, aching monuments to past-selves and lost relationships into a positivist statement of resilience and self-love. It’s a record that is impossible to listen to without a lump in your throat.",

        "bio": "LA-based Whispertown is the latest iteration of the unique vision of Morgan Meyn Nagler (songwriter, lead vocals, guitar).  What was once The Whispertown 2000 has morphed into a less structured version of itself, with Nagler’s unmistakable vocals leading a revolving cast of musicians and artists.  I'M A MAN (produced by Jake Bellows) out now on Graveface Records, marks Nagler’s return, and 3rd full length release. After being diagnosed with a polyp on her vocal cord, and faced with the possibility of never singing again, Nagler discovered she is without a doubt a “lifer”, and married to song writing, for better and for worse. I’M A MAN is a stripped back acoustic album, set in a naturally psychedelic world, where words reveal themselves in modern mantra - “New Genes in Blue Jeans”.\r\n \r\nIn various formations, Nagler and company garnered support slots for Jenny Lewis, The Breeders, M. Ward, Bright Eyes, She & Him, Maria Taylor, Rilo Kiley, Azure Ray, Conor Oberst and many more. The band soon caught the attention of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, inspiring the first signing to their own Acony Records. Shortly thereafter the band released 2008’s SWIM, their debut release from Acony, followed by 2012’s Parallel (the first release under the Whispertown moniker).\r\n \r\nIn addition to traveling around the world playing her own music,  Whispertown's Morgan Nagler has also worked countless co-writes with artists such as HAIM (“Falling”), Kim Deal (“The Root”,”Range on Castle”), Rilo Kiley (“Dreamworld”) and the Dave Rawlings Machine (“Sweet Tooth”) to name a few.",

        "bio": "Throughout history, human beings have relied on rituals—personal, religious, professional, social, creative, and otherwise. It’s these rites that establish a modicum of control and cohesion over a world that often seems far removed from both. When swimming through tragedy, turmoil, and tumult, those practices can function as life preservers. Sacramento duo Rituals of Mine—Terra Lopez and Dani Fernandez—realized that firsthand.\r\n\r\nAfter cobbling together demos in the Oakland walk-in closet where Terra slept at the time, the core sessions for Devoted took place in St. Augustine, FL. Terra and Dani spent two weeks in the studio with Jones writing and recording the bulk of material. They finished writing the final three tracks with Omar Rodriguez Lopez (At The Drive-In, The Mars Volta) in Los Angeles. Once the songs were chosen for the record, Jones dug in on production over the next several months, communicating across the country with the duo until the album was a realized vision. \r\n\r\n“It was the first time Dani and I had ever gone into the studio as a duo,” admits Terra. “It was a pretty insane experience to go into such extreme isolation in St. Augustine. The only person we really knew was Wes. There were absolutely no distractions. We could focus while there in the beauty of St. Augustine, surrounded in isolation.”\r\n\r\nAs a result, the ten tracks comprising Devoted could be likened to gorgeously haunted transmissions from a bygone era where Portishead and Massive Attack summoned spirits via analog drum machines and battered keyboards. The first single “Ride Or Die” fuses a stark bass hum and droning synth with Terra’s ethereal and evocative delivery before building into an angelic refrain- “All I want… is a Ride Or Die.”\r\n\r\n“I was in a place where I didn’t quite understand where my next step in life or love was going to be. I felt like a lot of my friends were feeling the exact same way. It’s the human condition of being lost, always looking for something, and hoping to find that connection whether it’s romantic, family, friendship, or just a general human touch. It’s an anthem for myself and those around me. Life can be really fucking hard. Let’s stick together.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Terra’s howl caresses an ominous sonic blanket punctuated by industrial undertones and glitch-y computer buzzing. “The word Devoted kept popping up in my head when I thought of our journey,” she goes on. “After all of the changes and hardships we had gone through, we were devoted to each other and our music. To me, it signified a theme for the entire record. I had just gotten through an incredible breakup. Instead of singing about heartbreak and loss, I wanted to transcend that and write about devotion in order to restore my faith in devotion.”\r\n\r\nUltimately, these Rituals are meant to be shared. \r\n\r\n“The music is created out of turmoil, and it’s genuine,” Terra leaves off. “It’s a passionate album. I want people to connect to it in a very human way and see that it’s raw. Maya Angelou said something that really connected with me. In regards to rehearsing or honing your craft, she said, ‘The process isn’t pretty, but it’s real.’ We create out of necessity. I hope that resonates and offers some solace.”",

        "bio": "The notion of “heavy music” is continuing to expand of late, with many intrepid artists finding new ways to incorporate the power of traditional metal into new music, but without all of its trappings. Enter Portland, OR quartet BlackWater HolyLight to further swirl musical elements into a captivating hybrid of emotional intensity. Heavy psych riffs, gothic drama, folk-rock vibes, garage-sludge and soaring melodies all collide into a satisfying whole with as much contrast as the band’s name itself. \r\n\r\n“I wanted to experiment with my own version of what felt ‘heavy’ both sonically and emotionally,” says founder and vocalist/bassist Allison Faris. “I also wanted a band in which vulnerability of any form could be celebrated.” BlackWater HolyLight — Faris, guitarist/vocalist Laura Hopkins, drummer Cat Hoch and synth player Sarah Mckenna — formed upon the breakup of Faris’ longtime band and she sought a fresh start. “In my last band I was the only female in a group of 6, so I wanted to see how my song writing and vulnerability could glow taking the drivers seat and working with women.”\r\n\r\nThe band’s self-titled debut begins with a simple, almost grunge-like riff as a chorus of voices introduce a melodic line in call-and-response until the band kicks in, slowly building into crescendo like a lost outtake from Led Zeppelin’s Houses of the Holy. Elsewhere, “Sunrise” begins with a chorus-drenched post-punk groove until a sonic boom of heavily distorted guitar skree erupts out of nowhere. Nearly as suddenly, the song returns to its lulling core, subtly building the tension until it ruptures completely in a blast of noise. Likewise, “Carry Her” establishes a dark, sparse melody and distinctly thin sounding drums not far removed from early work of The Cure. However, BlackWater HolyLight’s penchant for surprise attack finds a sudden shift into a doom-like dirge, colored with eerie synth notes and pounding shards of fuzz. Throughout the album, their songs shirk traditional verse-chorus-verse structure in favor of fluid, serpentine compositions that move with commanding grace. The band expertly, yet subconsciously, incorporates hints of Chelsea Wolfe, Celebration, Captain Beefheart, The Raincoats, The Stooges, Pink Floyd, Jane’s Addiction and more to form their unique brand of dark’n’heavy transcendence..\r\n\r\nBlackWater HolyLight was recorded by Cameron Speice at Gold Brick Studios and The Greenhouse, and with Eric Crespo at Touch Tourcher Recording in Portland. The album will be available on LP, CD and download April 6, 2018 via RidingEasy Records.",

        "bio": "Secret Drum Band is a percussion ensemble founded by Lisa Schonberg (Explode into Colors, Kickball) and based in Portland, OR. Secret Drum Band’s debut full length, Dynamics (XRAY Records, August 2017), see composers Schonberg, Allan Wilson, and Heather Treadway delving headway into creating living, breathing soundscapes, rich in rhythmic textures. Driven by four drummers, each song also employs an array of affected vocals, guitar, and synthesizers from noise musicians, often mimicking sounds found in nature. Schonberg's background in entomology & ecology informs her creative practice; her compositions are based on sound and movement, with the goal of bringing attention to specific environmental issues.\r\n\r\nStylistically, Secret Drum Band pull from a unique vantage point, drawing allusions from Liquid Liquid, The Creatures, and Crash Worship, as well as the composers’ previous groups Explode Into Colors and !!! (chk chk chk). \r\n\r\nDynamics features songs written in response to locations in the Mojave Desert, logging sites in Mount Hood National Forest in Oregon, and Hawai’i, where Schonberg’s entomology work has helped the native Hylaeus bees attain endangered species status. \"Kīpukapuaulu’s\" vibrant polyrhythmic cadences insinuate an endless vortex of bird calls, while the cacophonous tension of \"Jazz (Timber Sale)\" simultaneously evokes the complexity of the forest flora and the anxiety of approaching logging trucks.\r\n\r\nSecret Drum Band’s live performances are transportive, an opportune meditation on the relationships between humans, ecology and music. All pieces are carefully scored by Schonberg and Wilson, allowing each musician to realize the complex and intricate arrangements in a live setting. Their albums aptly capture this concentrated effort, allowing sharp details to roar within the thunder of the drums.\r\n\r\n “They’re not simply playing a show, they’re creating an immersive experience that lasts for a moment, then dissolves, creating a hypnotic alternate reality for all who bear witness to it.” —The Oregonian",

The group quickly gained notoriety throughout the Pacific Northwest for their eminently danceable live shows that feature the powerful vocals of frontman Tom Eddy (Beat Connection), bolstered by the deep pocket of their unmistakably detailed rhythm section, and the spirited melodies of “The Honeynut Horns”. Hard-hitting but sensitive, The Dip harkens back to the deep soul roots of the decades past and pays tribute to this history through the grit and grace of their performances. The band's 2015 self-titled debut, recorded to tape at Avast! Studios, propelled them to notable appearances at prodigious festivals such as Sasquatch! Music Festival, High Sierra Music Fest, Summer Meltdown, and Capitol Hill Block Party as well as built anticipation for their 2016 release, Won't Be Coming Back (EP). Whether young or old, you can’t help yourself from grinning ear-to-ear when you see these gentlemen hit the stage. I wouldn’t hold back dancing for that matter either! Ladies and gentleman, give it up for The Dip!  Hit up the dance floor, and put it in your hip!\"",

And then shrinking them back down to microscopic levels.\r\n\r\nWith the band’s immersive and textural new album Layers of Us, Lacy takes us on an epic journey that examines both “the infinite and the infinitesimal” with equal amounts of wonder.\r\n\r\nLayers of Us is Mimicking Birds’ third full-length album with producer Jeremy Sherrer (Modest Mouse, Dandy Warhols, The Shins). Recorded at Isaac Brock’s Ice Cream Party Studios, it’s easily their most ambitious work to date. If their self-titled 2010 debut established the band as fearlessly honest, and 2014’s Eons demonstrated added depth and experimentation, then Layers of Us represents the maturity that comes with touring extensively and continuing to expand their sound.\r\n\r\nLacy: “This album was shaped by our travels as a band. And just as much rhythmically and melodically as lyrically. On tour, time seems to stand still—in the songs we play again and again, in the geography we speed past.”\r\n\r\n“As a whole we continue to advance and broaden the parameters of our senses.”\r\n\r\nLayers of Us explores daunting topics like life, death, and eternity with a gentle touch. Lacy tenderly serenades us though this epic 10-song expedition that presents the full prismatic array of musical color.",

        "bio": "The missing link between indie-rock and classic country western is Atlanta based Neighbor Lady. Comprised of Emily Braden, Jack Blauvelt, Merideth Hanscom, and Andrew McFarland. Neighbor Lady began as a solo project for Emily Braden, writing music by herself and for herself; lyrically, the songs chronicle events in her personal life and her emotions surrounding those events. After high school, she moved to Athens, Georgia, met guitarist Jack Blauvelt and formed Neighbor Lady, a small band centered on supporting Emily’s songwriting. As Braden puts it, “Neighbor Lady started because I was too nervous to play a show by myself, so I asked my friends to play with me.”\r\n\r\nNeighbor Lady’s debut LP “Maybe Later” consists of 7 songs that introduce the band’s foundations of country kissed alt-rock in a poignantly sweet and evocative style- the album shifts fluidly between the dreamy, stripped down, aching melodies of just Braden and her guitar to the powerfully noisy and fiery hooks of the full band. Neighbor Lady’s momentum is indebted to their blend of a powerfully dynamic band paired with Braden’s soaring vocal melodies, creating a sensation both comforting yet heartbreaking in the same moments.\r\n\r\nFor listeners of Fleetwood Mac, Patsy Cline, Wilco, and Jenny Lewis.\r\n\r\nFriendship Fever is happy to close the polarizing gap between here and there with the release of “Maybe Later” on May 11th, 2018.",

        "bio": "Imaginary Tricks takes an experimental approach to delivering a familiar thump. It’s a heartbeat, with multiple layers of complex sounds, mired in soul and hidden lyrical depth. Welcome to the world of Mike Visser, the world of Imaginary Tricks.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t so much opening a map of music and dropping a finger on a destination as it was a methodical and sometimes arduous journey to where Visser is now. It started with the Sacramento, California band Frank Jordan—a tightly wound rock trio where Visser could learn to push his vocal range, the power of a good hook, what touring felt like in shit weather and what if felt like to open for some greats (Grandaddy, Dr. Dog, Jimmy Eat World). He just needed one more turn, one more journey into the abyss—traversing fear, self-realization, and what feeling truly alone was all about—before heading back into the world to share his discoveries.\r\n\r\nSo here we are now. Imaginary Tricks. Another journey for Visser, but this one feels different. Not that the past didn’t matter—it did. But the future holds so much more, and the new set of songs featured on Skommel lays it out for you to follow. A trip not so succinct that you can make your mind up quickly. Out there in the distance, just far enough that you have time to decide on what it all means.\r\n\r\nThe songs on Skommel are poignant and varied, from the surefire pop hit of“Night Owl,” which captures the universal feeling of staying up at night, worrying yourself to bits. And there’s the rugged and rhythmic “Lights Out,” addressing the distribution of wealth in the Western world. And in the disarming “No Ordinary Guy,” Visser details his father’s immigration from South Africa to the United States.\r\n\r\nListen closely, and you’re inside the room with him, in the eye of a storm, whipped up by whatever inclination strikes: whistles and wah-wahs, Doppler-effect vocals and alien Wurlitzer keyboarding. For his captivating live shows, he is joined by Harlan Muir, who contributes an alchemy of sounds, combining keys and tape delay. The results are intoxicating.\r\n\r\nMuch of Skommel was drafted and recorded at Japam Studio in Brooklyn. Conjuring up a romantic picture of a dank and dark place where the songs were pounded out night after night until they took shape would be a cool notion. But Imaginary Tricks songs are written in Visser’s head—one can only imagine what goes on in there—and then sketched out here, in the real world, for us to hear. Can colors, thoughts, dreams and sideways conversations be translated into words and music? After listening to Skommel, it just might seem possible.\r\n\r\nSkommel will be available on March 24, 2017 on Friendship Fever.",

Calling Denver, Colorado home, his innovation laden sounds claim a constant state of bewilderment, leaving no question to his intrinsic skill as he deepens his groove as a major player in an international circuit. With tracks circulating across seas and finding their way into the playlists of names like Noisia and Boombox Cartel, he continues to receive praise from some of the top names in bass music.\r\n\r\nRecently releasing a full Hip Hop EP with Ill Chill, the producer’s reaches seem to have no limits, nurturing a rapidly growing fan base with tastes just as large as his productions. Seeing collaborations with the likes of Emancipator and playing well matched alongside leading figures Hudson Mohawke and Truth, his involvement with respected labels Encrypted Audio and Deep Dark and Dangerous fuel an uncontainable flame. \r\n\r\nProliferating an impressive lineage of releases, his most recent addition, the ‘BLOCCD’ EP on Deep Dark and Dangerous stands as a true testament to a diversely adept artist’s deserved place as a gate-pushing contender within today’s expansive music scene. Prepared or not, the best from DMVU is coming for us when we least expect it.",

Other reasons (presented here in no particular order) for STK include: friendship, art, mild success, hard work never killed anyone/builds character, rock and roll is here to stay and it will never die and it was meant to be that way, together we are greater than the sum of our parts, the belief that we should strive to be on the right side of rock and roll history, etc. Skinny The Kid believes we are on this earth to feel and to dance.

        "bio": "Tijuana is a place where good music happens, It is a border town with a very storied history - sometimes a history of union, sometimes of violence. Such history has given it its own flavor: a hybrid culture with many vibrant scenes and artists that have defied their borders, playing for their own crowds, outsiders who always carve their own road, going from place to place around the globe until they find their corner of the world.\r\n\r\nMint Field’s story is similar, but with its own set of peculiarities. As it is with Tijuana, Estrella Sanchez and Amor Amezcua believe their roots are in the city but are not defined by it; it’s where they jump to find their own way and make the world at large their home. Their sound backs up this attitude. It’s an organic sound inhabited by specters that lurk behind repetitive rhythms, where Estrella’s angelic voice evokes a supernatural world of beauty and melancholy built by rock instruments and synthesizers. Like spirits that wander through our reality, they don’t anchor themselves to one place, yet it’s probable that something\\ like Mint Field might not have come out of anywhere else but Tijuana.\r\n\r\nMint Field are not spirits from beyond that have come to communicate with us through their own unique sound. In fact, they are two women that\r\nmake incredibly evocative music; they channel their inspirations and influences to transmit sentiments of profound sorrow, nostalgia and immaculate beauty, revisiting sounds from the past to make them contemporary.\r\n\r\nThis emotion is imprinted on the band's first album, Pasar De Las Luces, a records that has been described by the band as “basically a compilation of our lives from two years ago to now.” A mixtape, if you will, of completely original songs that resound with their recent history. Most of the songs achieve much with just a few basic melodic ideas and other circular riffs that never become self-indulgent, rather they form fully realized and memorable songs. Sanchez’s voices seem to wander in and out of the picture like rays of pure sunlight on a cloudy day, giving a little color to something that is otherwise blue and dark. There are winks to many musical styles like dream pop, jangle pop, indie, twee pop, fuzz saturated shoegaze, and the cycling repetitions of krautrock, as well as its basis of post punk with dark edges. Pasar De Las Luces was recorded and mixed by Christopher Koltay at High Bias recordings in Detroit, MI. Mastering was done by Heba Kadry at Timeless Mastering in Brooklyn, NY. Artwork was done by Emilio Villalba.",

With several projects, a critically acclaimed debut album in 2012, and the lone guest rap feature on Kendrick Lamar’s \"To Pimp A Butterfly\", she is quickly establishing herself as one of the best emcees of this generation. \r\n\r\nThe Idea of Beautiful was her debut album and XXL quoted that \"it might just be on of the best Hip-Hop debuts of late\".  In just a short time she has worked with some of the biggest legends and newcomers in the business, ranging from the likes of Erykah Badu, Raekwon, Big Daddy Kane, and Marsha Ambrosius to Estelle, Kendrick Lamar, Mac Miller and Big K.R.I.T, to name a few.\r\n\r\nShe toured with Mac Miller in 2011 on the Incredibly Dope Tour, as well as Phonte and 9th Wonder, and performed at the 2012 Paid Dues Festival.  Also in 2012, Hot 97 included Rapsody in their list of \"Who's Next\" artist of the year, she was featured in The Source Magazine's \"Rising Venus\" list of female artist, a XXL Show and Prove artist, also became an official BET Music Matters artist.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Rapsody released her highly anticipated mixtape, She Got Game hosted by DJ Drama, featuring Jay Electronica, Common, Ab-Soul, DJ Premier and more.  The project received rave reviews and was featured as one of Pepsi's Mixtapes of the Month.  She Got Game was also a top mixtape of the year on Hip Hop DX and XXL 2013 list, and the single \"Lonely Thoughts\" ft Chance the Rapper was voted in NPR's Top 100 songs of the year.  In 2013, Rapsody performed in the BET Hip Hop Cypher as well as Rock the Bells.  She was also named one of New Music Seminar's \"Artist on the Verge\" for their 2014 Top 100, and regarded as a top artist to know by both TIME Magazine and USA Today. To end the year, XXL named Rapsody one of the 20 Greatest Female Rappers of All Time.\r\n\r\nBeauty and the Beast, her 7th project, was a 10 song EP she released with no features in 2014. Fueled by three singles, Drama, Godzilla and The Man, the EP’s was welcomed with rave reviews.  \r\n\r\nIn 2015, Rapsody gained a huge boost of momentum when she was called on by Kendrick Lamar to have the only guest rap feature on what was the most anticipated album of year.  Some months later, while in LA working on her sophomore album, Rapsody met Dr. Dre who ended up cosigning her via video and called her “his new favorite female emcee” on his Apple Beats 1 radio show.  She also was featured on Talib Kweli and 9th Wonder’s Indie 500 Compilation, and performed “Every Ghetto” along side Talib Kweli on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.

Two weeks later, Rapsody performed at the White House along with Terrace Martin, Herbie Hancock, Robert Glasper, and Aretha Franklin at International Jazz Festival, as a tribute to the late Prince Rogers Nelson.",

Feverishly gigging around the Bay Area, The Pleasure Routine gained the attention of Ricky Maymi (The Brian Jonestown Massacre), who produced the sessions for Sugar Mountain, along with engineer Greg Ashley (Gris Gris). The collaboration proved integral to the development of the group, as Maymi helped The Pleasure Routine refine its sound. It also opened the doors to support more established acts like Palma Violets, Public Access T.V., and China’s Carsick Cars.",

        "bio": "Frustrated by academia and emotionally raw from a breakup, Faustina Masigat stepped away from her peers in her mid-twenties. She had come to realize that her personal and artistic maturation had been stifled by her relationships and her overly angular traditional musical schooling. She knew she needed to spend more time alone, committed to a process of unlearning, before she could move forward. As she peeled back the rigid layers of her youth, she began to write the songs that, a few years later, would make up her debut record. Seeking honesty over perfection, her approach to composition became much more intuitive; seated in the natural expression of not only her emotional life, but also that of a spiritual life, an expression of her own femininity, and a means of self-improvement through self-reflection. She became obsessed with the old, forgotten, second-hand guitars she would find in the “As Is” section of local music shops, believing that magic and songs still lived in the beat-up wood. One album track, “Willie Nelson”, manifested, fully formed, from one of these guitars - an ancient, label-less individual that she called ‘Red’. \r\n\r\nThe songwriting on her self-titled debut is all at once heartbreaking, intelligent, meditative and elegant - centered around a voice that is difficult to attach genre to. There is a quiet intensity running through the world that Faustina creates: sweet and heavy, a touch of angst, brutally honest, smoldering. The album is understated, arranged as to allow Faustina’s effortless rapport with pedal steel player Tucker Jackson (The Minus 5, The Delines) to shine clearest. It’s a spacious and lush debut, with all of her vulnerabilities laid bare in songs hemmed together with fragile intimacy. \r\n\r\nFaustina Masigat will be released on April 6th, 2018 via Mama Bird Recording Co. It was recorded by Rian Lewis, mixed by Ben Nugent and mastered by Timothy Stollenwerk, all in Portland, Oregon.",

This Toronto-based singer has nailed the harmonies and guitar sound that is part of pop's DNA. – NPR Music\r\n\r\nLiving Daylight strikes a playfully wobbly balance between in-the- room rawness and cerebral strangeness. - Pitchfork\r\n\r\nCombining the blown-out sounds of the lo-fi movement with complex melodies and laid-back moods, Rault sounds like the second coming of cult pop idol Emitt Rhodes. - Entertainment Weekly\r\n\r\nRault maintains his captivating mix of pop, fuzz-rock, and neo-psychedelia until the last groovy guitar riff. - SPIN\r\n\r\nCombining psych fuzz with ‘60s soul and lovelorn lyrics, the Toronto-based musician comes off like a one-man Tame Impala taking on the songs of Donovan. – NME",

        "bio": "Recording both as Parliament and Funkadelic, George Clinton revolutionized R&B during the ’70s, twisting soul music into funk by adding influences from several late-’60s acid heroes: Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, and Sly Stone. The Parliament/Funkadelic machine ruled black music during the ’70s, capturing over 40 R&B hit singles (including three number ones) and recording three platinum albums.\r\n\r\nBorn in Kannapolis, NC, on July 22, 1941, Clinton became interested in doo wop while living in New Jersey during the early ’50s. . Basing his group on Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, Clinton formed The Parliaments in 1955, rehearsing in the back room of a Plainfield barbershop where he straightened hair. The Parliaments released only two singles during the next ten years, but frequent trips to Detroit during the mid-’60s – where Clinton began working as a songwriter and producer – eventually paid off their investment.\r\n\r\nThe Parliaments finally had a hit with the 1967 single “(I Wanna) Testify” for the Detroit-based Revilot Records, but the label ran into trouble and Clinton refused to record any new material. Instead of waiting for a settlement, Clinton decided to record the same band under a new name: Funkadelic. Founded in 1968, the group began life as a smoke screen, claiming as its only members the Parliaments’ backing but in truth including Clinton and the rest of the former Parliaments lineup. Revilot folded not long after, with the label’s existing contracts sold to Atlantic; Clinton, however, decided to abandon the Parliaments name rather than record for the major label.\r\n\r\nBy 1970, George Clinton had regained the rights to The Parliaments name: he then signed the entire Funkadelic lineup to Invictus Records as Parliament. The group released one album – 1970’s Osmium – and scored a number 30 hit, “The Breakdown,” on the R&B charts in 1971. With Funkadelic firing on all cylinders, however, Clinton decided to discontinue Parliament (the name, not the band) for the time being.\r\n\r\nInspired by Motown‘s assembly line of sound, George Clinton gradually put together a collective of over 50 musicians and recorded the ensemble during the ’70s both as Parliament and Funkadelic. While Funkadelic pursued band-format psychedelic rock, Parliament engaged in a funk free-for-all, blending influences from the godfathers (James Brown and Sly Stone) with freaky costumes and themes inspired by ’60s acid culture and science fiction. From its 1970 inception until Clinton’s dissolving of Parliament in 1980, Clinton hit the R&B Top Ten several times but truly excelled in two other areas: large-selling, effective album statements and the most dazzling, extravagant live show in the business. In an era when Philly soul continued the slick sounds of establishment-approved R&B, Parliament / Funkadelic scared off more white listeners than it courted. (Ironically, today Clinton’s audiences are a cross-cultural mix of music lovers from 8 to 80.)\r\n\r\n1978-79 was the most successful year in Parliament/Funkadelic history: Parliament hit the charts first with “Flash Light,” P-Funk’s first R&B number one. “Aqua Boogie” would hit number one as well late in the year, but Funkadelic‘s title track to “One Nation Under a Groove” spent six weeks at the top spot on the R&B charts during the summer. The album, which reflected a growing consistency in styles between Parliament and Funkadelic, became the first Funkadelic LP to reach platinum (the same year that Parliament‘s “Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome” did the same). In 1979, Funkadelic‘s “(Not Just) Knee Deep” hit number one as well, and its album (“Uncle Jam Wants You”) also reached platinum status.\r\n\r\nDuring 1980, Clinton began to be weighed down by legal difficulties arising from Polygram‘s acquisition of Parliament‘s label, Casablanca. Jettisoning both the Parliament and Funkadelic names (but not the musicians), Clinton began his solo career with 1982’s “Computer Games”. Several months later, Clinton’s “Atomic Dog” hit number one on the R&B charts; it stayed at the top spot for four weeks, but only managed number 101 on the pop charts. Clinton stayed on Capitol for three more years, releasing three studio albums and frequently charting singles in the R&B Top 40.\r\n\r\nClinton and many former Parliament/Funkadelic members continued to tour and record throughout the ’80s as the P-Funk All Stars, but the decade’s disdain of everything to do with the ’70s – especially the sound of disco – resulted in critical and commercial neglect for the world’s biggest funk band, one which in part had spawned dance music..\r\n\r\nDuring much of the three-year period from 1986 to 1989, Clinton became embroiled in legal difficulties (resulting from the myriad royalty problems latent during the ’70s with recordings of over 40 musicians for four labels under three names). Also problematic during the latter half of the ’80s was Clinton’s disintegrating reputation as a true forefather of rock; by the end of the decade, however, a generation of rappers reared on P-Funk were beginning to name check him.\r\n\r\nThe early ’90s saw the rise of funk-inspired rap (courtesy of Digital Underground, Dr. Dre, and Warren G.) and funk rock (Primus and Red Hot Chili Peppers) that re-established the status of Clinton & co. as one of the most important forces in the recent history of black music. Clinton’s music became the soundtrack for the rap movement, as artists from MC Hammer, to LL Cool J to Snoop Doggy Dogg depended heavily on the infectious groove of Clinton productions as the foundation of their recordings.\r\n\r\nAlong with the renewed notoriety and respect, Clinton’s visibility and presence became familiar to a wider audience thanks to appearances in movies “The Night Before”, “House Party”, “PCU”, and “Good Burger”, hosting the HBO original series “Cosmic Slop”, and doing commercials for Apple computers, Nike, and Rio Mp3 players. Clinton also composed the theme songs for popular TV programs “The Tracey Ulman Show” and “The PJs”.\r\n\r\nClinton has received a Grammy, a Dove (gospel) , and an MTV music video awards, and has been recognized by BMI, the NAACP Image Awards, and Motown Alumni Association for lifetime achievement. Clinton’s Partliament/Funkadelic was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing Clinton’s illustrious career and success as a producer / writer/ performer, perhaps his greatest achievement stemmed from his relentless dedication to funk as a musical form. Funk as a musical style had been around for what seems like forever, deeply rooted in the music traditions of New Orleans and the Blues of the Deep South. Following the lead – and commercial success – of James Brown and Sly Stone, Clinton took Funk to new heights, blending elements of Jazz, Rock, Pop, Classical and even Gospel into his productions, eventually developing a unique and easily identifiable style affectionately called “Pfunk.” Clinton’s inspiration, dedication and determination resulted in the elevation of “funk” music to complete recognition and acceptance as a true genre in and of itself.\r\n\r\nOn February 16th, 2012 George Clinton added to his list of accomplishments a Honorary Doctorate of Music from the renowed Berklee College of Music.\r\n\r\n",

Artistic Director Lydia Sakolsky-Basquill has been taking part in a creative writing class, led by CSI instructor Shane Brown, among 10-15 ISCC inmates with the intention of creating work based on the writings of these inmates. The creative non-fiction writings touch on the inmates’ memories and experiences both in and out of prison. The project, which began in August 2017 has proven to be a rewarding, inspiring, and challenging experience for all involved in the process. For Treefort, Lydia and her dancers will allow the public to view Project Flux's live works and process, which will culminate in a performance in that same space, with pop up performances in various spaces to follow. The final work is set to debut at MING Studios June 2018. \r\n",

        "bio": "In 2011, Kelli Schaefer released her first full length record Ghost of the Beast - a compilation of singles released throughout 2009 on the artist-run label Amigo Amiga Recordings. A surprising follow up to her 2008 Lasso the Moon EP, Ghost of the Beast is a haunting art-pop record with a backbone made of steel and distortion. Schaefer garnered praise and attention, sharing the stage with Damien Jurado, Wild Flag, and the Corin Tucker Band. Included in Willamette Week’s “Best New Band” poll, with a music video featured on Paste, tracks featured on NPR and KEXP, and multiple regional festival appearances, Schaefer’s debut was gaining momentum in the northwest.\r\n\r\nBut when Schaefer decided to step back from the whirlwind of live shows to focus on her follow up, she found that she wanted to go in a different direction. She kicked off this exploration with a self-produced, limited release EP titled 601 in May of 2013, debuting the beginnings of her new sound. Starting in 2014, she joined back up with Ghost of the Beast producer Drew Grow, and her bandmates Jeremiah Hayden and 601 guitarist Ryan Lynch, and found her vision had shifted to a more conceptual, unhinged rock and roll sound. \r\n\r\nNo Identity is darker than Ghost of the Beast, growling with confidence - but with a sense of humor. Confidence was hard-won, coming out of the passing of her father and dealing with the unavoidable ripples from it, the record was as much shaped by life and life was shaped around the record. The title track of No Identity kicks off with a beat as strong as a heart and a guitar line threatening to explode. \r\n\r\nMirroring the expansive noise and incisive shadow of PJ Harvey, with the fearless abandon of Nick Cave, and vocal play of Bjork, No Identity travels at light speed through the American landscape so many of us left and forgot to examine.\r\n\r\nThe melodies are pop with meat on their bones, robust and full, unafraid to stick in your head and to your ribs. It is art-pop with depth and vision, the product of an artist who not only carved out a space for herself, but has grown into a voice that has the potential to reshape a well-worn world. \r\n\r\nNo Identity earns Schaefer a reputation as one of Portland's strongest songwriters.  NPR included the band’s in-studio performance in their “Essentials of 2017” list noting that “through chopped-up verses and soaring choruses, she turned in one of the most impressive performances I've seen in years,” while a KEXP review of a recent live show found ”her music stares into the abyss, but she continues to come back unscathed and stronger than before.\"\r\n\r\nLate this year, Schaefer worked with electronic artist Mija, who reproduced the final track from “NO Identity” into a song Spin says “splits the difference between Bjork & ODESZA,” while Pitchfork noted “Kelli Schaefer has some of the xx’s Romy Madley Croft’s velvet hush in her vocals.” In the track’s premiere, Noisey dug deeper into the intention of the song, saying “Schaefer's lyrics are an us-against-the-world sort of thing, singing about the ways that the shitty state of affairs can bind people together.” “Bad For U” released Nov 30, 2017.",

Nor is it necessarily the nostalgia factor, though it does channel Lookout! Records and 90’s pop punk in all of the best ways. No, it’s the fact that the songwriting is just that good, and all of the correct musical pieces are in place. Where catchiness and cleverness meet, Wicked Bears make their home. And in the way other punk bands have increasingly started losing themselves in pretentious technicality and forced emotion, Wicked Bears decided they have no time for that. Tuning Out clocks ten songs in under 30 minutes, and anything more would be overkill.\r\n\r\nWith some tours, a strong cult following, and a growing West Coast reputation blossoming under their belts (not to mention the best punk record of 2017), the new year doesn’t see anything slowing down or stopping for Wicked Bears. After all, the band just started taking over the world of pop punk. With this kind of momentum, who could ever stop them?\r\n\r\nGene Scallop, Hidden Home PR",

        "bio": "Boise, Idaho’s Jonathan Warren and the Billy Goats - comprised of Jonathan Warren (guitar, upright bass, vocals), Dave Sather-Smith (cello, guitar, vocals), and Austin Clark (violin, guitar,vocals) - step it up a notch on their fourth full-length, Bless My Soul, an eight track collection of folk and bluegrass the band has dubbed “progressive psychobilly folk-grass.”\r\n\r\nFollowing up their three previous records - 2010's You Just Relax Honey, 2011's A Little Something Stronger Than Wine, and 2013's On This Very Evening - Bless My Soul showcases a band that is both rustic and forward-thinking, blending the traditions of Appalachian bluegrass with a big city twist.\r\n\r\nStarting with “Quite Like you Lady,” Bless My Soul opens with a keyboard-drenched, soul-tinted Americana number that eases you into the rich textures of the album.  Soon slipping into “Concrete,” the band picks it up, delivering a toe-tapping, danceable song that melds their Americana leanings with their subtle folk heritage.\r\n\r\nOn the slower, meditative bluegrass of “Rest My Head,” the band delivers melody with relaxation.  On the title track - and album’s first single - folk-grass comes alive, as both genres come together beautifully to create a slice of rustic nostalgia.\r\n\r\n“Be There For Me” drives home the bluegrass influences, while “Down The Line” ends with a bang, reinforcing the band’s self-described “progressive psychobilly folk-grass” sound.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what his overall feeling is about the record, Warren is quick to state, “This record is a refreshing oasis of honest, soulful music.  The lyrics and music fit organically; when writing most of the songs, the lyrics and melodies came simultaneously to me.  I ended up recording what I had originally sang into my phone, the lyrics and the melody, and didn’t change a thing for the final album.”\r\n\r\nWarren’s commitment to staying organic and going with his original ideas helped ensure the album was genuine and heartfelt; hinging from dark and dirty to angelic, from summertime love to the loneliness of winter.  Telling tales of love found, love lost, and everything in between.\r\n\r\nPart of the organic process was recording this record straight to 8-track tape, something Warren is very proud of.\r\n\r\n“It was a pure joy,” he says of recording to 8-track tape.  “The recording sounds warm and organic.  I couldn’t be happier with it.”\r\n\r\n“I always strive to record an album where every song can stand on its own and there are no filter songs,” states Warren.  “I believe we did this with Bless My Soul. This album shows our maturation as a band and reflects the knowledge we have gained through our mistakes in previous recording experiences.”\r\n\r\nThe end result is a record that will remind you of the hum of your grandmother’s kitchen, the ripple of the Tennessee River, and the creaky front gate that takes your breath away and makes you say “bless my soul.”",

For Treefort Music Fest, it will be adapted into a duet performed by Mosko and Silverman. \r\n\r\nSUITED draws from Mosko and Silverman’s shared interests in movement, empirical inquiry, and social awareness. Through the use of playing cards, SUITED explores relationships between organization, chance, and chaos. It investigates how the intermingling of seemingly opposite phenomena—structure and disarray, physicality and sensitivity, individuality and community—shape the world around us. The resulting dance—a piece performed by women—uses these concepts to delve into the perceptions and expectations of femininity inside a divisive but also inclusive modern world.",

She grew up on a mountain in Alaska where she had no one to talk to, moved to Portland after being diagnosed with metastatic thyroid cancer and coming close to losing her voice forever - but she didn’t lose it, and now she won’t shut up. Becky was an audience favorite at the prestigious Big Sky and Bridgetown Comedy Festivals, was selected to perform in the IFC Showcase at the All Jane Comedy Festival, and has also performed at Hell Yes Fest, the 208 Comedy Fest, SF Sketchfest, the Beast Village Comedy Festival, the Idaho Laugh Fest, Pickathon, the Golden Spike Comedy Festival (selected for 'Best of the Fest'), the Siren Nation Festival, NW Women’s Comedy Festival, and the Hudson Valley Comedy Festival. Her comedy has been distributed on Audible. Winning 3rd place for ‘Best Comedian’ in the Willamette Week’s 2017 Best of Portland, and selected for the Portland Mercury's 2017 'Undisputable Geniuses of Comedy', the Willamette Week's 'Funniest Five', as well as Helium Comedy Club’s ‘Best of Portland’, Becky hosts a spectacular monthly comedy show called 'Becky with the Good Jokes' which has included appearances by Matt Braunger, Jenny Conlee from The Decemberists, and the mayor of Anchorage, Alaska. She studied at the same acting school as Liam Neeson, and has a specific set of skills - which include illustrating #FatAnimals, being able to lip-sync the entirety of ‘Pehla Nasha’ from the 1992 hit Bollywood film Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, and demolitions.",

        "bio": "Born out of fierce friendship and a mutual affection for melody, Chicago’s Ratboys – anchored by the partnership of Julia Steiner and Dave Sagan – aims to ‘write songs that tell stories and honor the intimacy of memory,’ according to Steiner.  \r\n  \r\nGN, the group’s second full-length album via Topshelf Records, offers a bevy of tales, laments and triumphs, which recount near-tragedies by the train tracks, crippling episodes of loneliness, remembrances of a deceased family pet with freezer burn, and on and on. The songs shift and breathe as worlds all their own, tied together by the group’s self-proclaimed ‘post-country’ sound, which combines moments of distortion and a DIY aesthetic with a devotion to simple songwriting and ties to the Americana sounds of years past.\r\n\r\nDrawing influence from the down-to-earth sincerity of late-90s Sheryl Crow and the confessional confidence of Kim Deal and Jenny Lewis, the songs on GN (aka ‘goodnight’) “largely detail experiences of saying goodbye, finding your way home, and then figuring out what the hell to do once you’re back,” says Steiner. The songs chosen to close both sides of the record – the slow-burning ‘Crying About the Planets’ and quizzical ‘Peter the Wild Boy’ – unpack the respective journeys of two real people who were quite literally lost and found. ‘’Crying’ tells the survival story of Antarctic explorer Douglas Mawson from a first-person perspective, and ‘Peter’ reflects on the life of a feral child in Germany who was eventually adopted by the King of England,’ according to Steiner. ‘Writing as and about these people is the best way I can attempt to empathize with them and really just wrap my mind around these bits of history that otherwise might not get talked about. And it helps me understand my own experiences a little bit better,’ she says.\r\n\r\nCertain personal stories – the tour adventures recapped in ‘GM,’ the struggle to learn to show affection as divulged in ‘Molly’ – find Ratboys just as eagerly exploring subject matter that comes from within, and then illustrating the highs and lows with soaring hooks and plaintive ones. Even in the moments that lie somewhere between bliss and misery, a tension persists between Steiner’s sweet vocal delivery and Sagan’s physical, almost-off-the-hinges guitar playing that lends each song a deeper sense of color and movement.",

        "bio": "It’s been more than 20 years since Ben Ellman, Robert Mercurio, Stanton Moore, Jeff Raines and Rich Vogel began exploring the seemingly limitless musical possibilities born out of their work together as Galactic. Since then, the seminal New Orleans band has consistently pushed artistic boundaries on the road and in the studio, approaching their music with open ears and drawing inspiration as much from the sounds bubbling up from their city’s streets as they do from each other.\r\nA key part of that creative spark comes from the teamwork of Mercurio and Ellman, whose ever-evolving production and arranging skills helped usher the band into a new phase of studio work beginning with the loop-centric “Ruckus” in 2007. A series of albums focused around specific concepts like Carnival followed, as did collaborations with guests hailing from worlds outside the one Galactic calls its own.\r\nOn “Into the Deep,” the band members look within themselves instead, drawing inspiration from people and ideas that have long been close to their hearts – and, in turn, close to the development of their unique sound. Shot through with soul, funk, blues and rock, the result is an organic riff on elements of Galactic’s past, filtered through the lens of where they’re headed in 2015.\r\n“I see this album as a kind of culmination of all of our collaborations or experiences, from [trombonist] Corey Henry to the people we met on the road, touring,” says Mercurio, referencing Ellman’s first full-time gig in New Orleans, which kicked off when Henry hired him into the Little Rascals Brass Band in 1989.\r\n“The previous albums took us in the opposite direction,” Mercurio says. “We collaborated with rappers that we had never dealt with and even on the New Orleans tracks, we didn’t have working experience with most of those artists before the recordings.”\r\nIn contrast, “Into the Deep” contributors like JJ Grey, David Shaw and Maggie Koerner spent significant time touring with Galactic. A few years ago, Mavis Staples sat in with the band, all of whom are longtime fans of the legendary singer’s R&B-meets-gospel soul style. They caught up with Macy Gray when she performed a memorable concert at Tipitina’s where Ellman says he could see from the outset “how much she cares about the music.” And each of the players had also developed a deep appreciation for the Honorable South’s Charm Taylor, whose contribution, “Right On” was written specifically to suit her vibe.\r\n“Quint Davis [the producer of] Jazz Fest always has a couple people he books at the festival that aren’t big names but that Quint knows are going to be super cool,” says Ellman. “That’s how we met Brushy One-String. We originally wanted to bring him in to do anything, just to see what would happen. But when we heard his song ‘Chicken in the Corn,’ we really wanted to do our version of it.”\r\nIn the end, he joined them on the road for over a month, collaborating with the band onstage at each show.\r\nFor the instrumental tracks, Galactic mined the interests and tastes they’ve cultivated together for years in New Orleans. “Buck 77” was written via improvisation, a long-standing cornerstone of their live shows. The funky bass line and tumbling guitar part on “Long Live the Borgne,” meanwhile, represents an updated, more composed take on some of the concepts that made early albums like “Coolin’ Off” so strong.\r\nAs for the opener “Soogar Doosie,” Ellman points out Galactic tends to record at least one track on each album that speaks to the band’s collective love of brass band music.\r\n“We write [those songs] with the idea of how awesome it would be to hear the Rebirth going down doing the street in a second line playing one of our songs. We try to think of a real second line song that would get people slapping stop signs and dancing on cars,” he says.\r\nThe album, Ellman says “is all about people. It’s these connections we’ve made over 20 years. They’re people in our orbit that have come into our little world and affected us in some way.”\r\nIt’s also about how the individual musicians within Galactic have grown over time. When it comes to trying new approaches as players, producers, songwriters and arrangers, Ellman muses, “it’s an evolution.”",

        "bio": "The musical collective known as Antibalas (Spanish for bullet-proof or anti-bullets) was conceived in Mexico City and formed in Brooklyn New York. The early nucleus of the group was composed of the band's founder Martín Perna and included several members from the Soul Providers / Dap Kings band, performing their first show in May 1998 in Harlem, NY. Soon after, Lagos, Nigeria native Amayo joined after seeing the band at a neighborhood concert. Fluent in the afrobeat music of Fela, he began composing and performing lyrics and assuming the role of the group's lead vocalist / frontman. The band began rehearsing and composing at Desco 41st street studios and later at the first Daptone Studios at Amayo's Afro Spot venue. They spent their first year performing exclusively in noncommercial spaces in lofts, community centers, parks, art galleries.  In August 1999, they created a weekly residence called Africalia at Tribeca club NoMoore that ran for 18 months, where the band and repertoire expanded. \r\n\r\nIn 2001, following their debut record (reissued independently, then licensed to Ninja Tune) they began touring internationally, from Glastonbury, Montreux to Newport Jazz and other renowned rock, jazz and world music festivals. Around 2003, following their third album \"Who Is This America,\" the Dap Kings and Antibalas both became busy, each group developed its separate full-time lineup although the groups would remain close, later reuniting with Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings and Charles Bradley for the 2014 Daptone Super Soul Revue across summer festivals and theaters in Europe and culminating in a three night run at New York's Apollo Theater. The group toured heavily performing over one hundred shows per year spread across North America and Europe between 2002 and 2007 with the releases of their third album, \"Who Is This America\", and fourth, \"Security\".\r\n\r\nFrom 2007-2012 many members and former members of the Antibalas participated in the Tony-Award winning Broadway musical FELA!, including the show's musical director Aaron Johnson, lead saxophonist Stuart Bogie, and assistant MD trumpeter Jordan McLean. In 2011, the group returned to the Daptone House of Soul to record their most recent album, \"Antibalas\" produced by emeritus member Gabriel Roth. The group toured heavily throughout the US and Europe, and later that year, performed songs from the album live on NBC's Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live. \r\n\r\nAntibalas has recorded five studio albums on the Daptone, Ninja Tune, Anti-, and Ropeadope labels as well as a number of singles and EPs. The band is currently finishing their sixth studio album due out in mid-2017. Though recognized for their fluency in Afrobeat and funk music, the band is known to collaborate with diverse groups and artists, from Angélique Kidjo to Jovanotti to Medeski Martin & Wood to Public Enemy, and served as the house band at Carnegie Hall in 2014 (Music of Paul Simon), 2015 (Music of David Byrne & Talking Heads) and most recently 2017’s Music of Aretha Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe Antibalas horns have performed on Grammy award-winning albums by Angelique Kidjo, Mark Ronson and dozens of albums, soundtracks and live guest appearances with artists including The Roots, My Morning Jacket, Santigold, Ed Sheeran, Alabama Shakes, The String Cheese Incident and numerous others.",

When the need is great, they appear with the Magic Sword and a high stakes proposition for those who are pure of heart, perpetually hoping that their search is finally over. The hope is that one day soon one of those who wield the Magic Sword will in fact be the Chosen One, and the enormous power they wield from the Sword will be immeasurably amplified and drive the Shadowbringer back into his cage. Until that fateful day, The Dreadlords of the Nameless One continue to call forth the power of evil and destroy all that is pure and decent in the world with the malevolent forces of Darkness.",

His debut vinyl 12\" & third solo album, entitled Courtesy Loaner, will be released by New York's Arcane Records this March, and highlights the producer's work best work to date with just an MPC, sampler, and a MIDI keyboard, with five songs that float in the realms of funk, boogie, and deep house.\r\n\r\nAfter making a splash at Volume Festival last year, and with an eye towards an overseas jaunt in the near future, Soul Ipsum continues to find new audiences across the Pacific Northwest who might not normally have an ear towards underground dance tracks by helping spread an appreciation for live hardware (non-laptop based) electronic music.",

        "bio": "The Mutineers are a twangy rock duo that blends the influences of Johnny and June with John Doe and Exene, and a bit of Nick Cave and PJ Harvey. The little band with a big sound has reinvented itself after the loss of founding member, Michael Astudillo, in 2014. Their latest album, Live at B-side, was released in November of 2016. The husband and wife team of Brian Mathusek and Merry Young recorded 100% live in Portland, OR at B-Side Studios with engineer Raymond Richards of The Parson Redheads. The project combined 7 new songs with 4 remakes of tracks from their first EPs. Live at B-side showcases the duo's ability to capture the essence of their best known songs with their newly streamlined arrangements. The album begins, and is founded on, their latest songwriting, created with one electric guitar, drums, and two voices, heavy with the angst of their recent past, defiant and earnest in carrying on. The strength of the duo lies in its own intimate nature, in compelling harmonies and barebones instrumentation. Live at B-side is a reintroduction done in the most vulnerable way, naked, without production. \r\n \r\nThe Mutineers have been on the road for most of 2017 in support of their latest album, completing two US tours while maintaining Portland, OR as their home city. The Mutineers were featured at the 2017 Treefort MusicFest and at the Wildwood Music Festival in Sheridan, OR this summer.",

        "bio": "Madeline Kenney is a renaissance woman. She has a degree in neuroscience, is a skilled artist, painter and knitter, was a baker for over 9 years, and makes ends meet by nannying during the day. One might wonder where she finds the time for music, but not only has she been a musician since the age of three, but she also writes and records her own material, currently teaches voice and piano lessons, runs a small record label and is learning how to produce and engineer at the Women’s Audio Mission – the only women-built and run studio in the world.\r\n\r\nKenney moved to the Bay Area in 2014 to pursue a career in baking, but ultimately found a supportive local arts community that inspired her to return to her musical roots. A chance encounter with Toro Y Moi’s Chaz Bear resulted in her debut EP Signals, which was produced by Bear and released on his label Company Records. Immediately after its release, Kenney began working on her debut album. As with Signals, Bear was on hand as producer, but with Kenney as the writer, arranger and key creative force. Kenney also appears on a track on Toro Y Moi’s latest album Boo Boo.\r\n\r\nAn accomplished full-length debut, Night Night At The First Landing is a cohesive record balanced by serene beauty, cathartic breakdowns, Kenney’s powerful voice, and masterfully complex and emotional lyrics. Night Night is unavoidably dreamy, dipping into sweet fuzz while sailing through smooth, crystalline production. Though Night Night At The First Landing is technically her first full-length, music has always been a key part of Kenney’s life. Singing came naturally to the bold-voiced Kenney and she was singing loudly before beginning to study piano at the age of five. To call this record a “debut” is something of a misnomer, as those who know Kenney best might note: she’s always made music. And for the sake of music lovers, she hopefully always will.",

        "bio": "Magic revolves around the number two. Opposite halves define our existence. There’s dark and light, black and white, night and day, yin-and-yang, and so on and so forth. \r\n \r\nOn their 2017 EP 2, critically acclaimed Idaho-born and Portland-based indie outfit Shook Twins draw on the inherent power of the group’s namesake duo—identical twin sisters Katelyn Shook [vocals, guitar] and Laurie Shook [banjo, vocals]. In early 2017, the pair holed up alone in a room with just two voices and two instruments and cut the seven-song collection live to tape, serving up bare bones renditions of fan favorites, covers, and one new tune entitled “Safe.”\r\n \r\n“Musically, it differs from our other studio albums, because it’s just two twins in a room performing on two instruments,” explains Katelyn. “It’s much more raw emotionally and almost vulnerable. It’s nice to hear our growth as a duo and notice our individual grooves. It showcases these songs in a different way than they had been or will be recorded. It’s just a taste of the simplest core of our band: The Shook Twins.”\r\n \r\n“It goes back to the very beginning,” adds Laurie. “When we were 18, we started writing songs together, just the two of us. We practiced how to blend our voices and instruments, trying to make our 2 voices and 2 instruments sound like one thing instead of 4 separate pieces. That’s how we started this whole musical life. We wanted to go back to that for a minute and remember.”\r\n\r\nThe process represents something of a full circle moment for Shook Twins. The group emerged in 2008 with their independent debut You Can Have The Rest followed by Window and 2014’s What We Do—which garnered acclaim from USA Today and more. Organically stirring up a buzz, they engendered fandom in fellow creators such as Langhorne Slim, The Lumineers, Mason Jennings, and iconic best-selling author Neil Gaiman who claimed, “They make music that twines through your soul the way vines cover an abandoned shack in the woods.” Along the way, the full band, including Niko Slice [electric guitar, mandolin, vocals], Barra Brown [drums, vocals, drum pad], and Josh Simon [bass, vocals, electric guitar, synth], has shared bills with everyone from Ryan Adams to The Indigo Girls. Moreover, they graced the stages of High Sierra, Bumbershoot, Hulaween, Floydfest, Summer Camp Music Festival, Oregon County Fair, Fayetteville Roots Festival, Northwest String Summit and many more in addition to performing at Red Rocks alongside Gregory Alan Isakov and Ani DiFranco. Their artful amalgam of folk heart, indie spirit, and alternative energy has effectively captivated fans internationally.",

It’s a reference to feminist writer bell hooks who speaks of intersectionality and solidarity in their work. Being a queer, gender nonconforming person of color Sean cannot isolate forms of oppression. The roar represents the fight to not be silent and to use their creative voice to stop ongoing domination. The goal of the music is to reinforce solidarity within the movement and create affirming spaces for queer and trans people of color. They’ve taught themselves to play multiple instruments and produce in order to keep the project true to their voice and self sustaining. They have performed everywhere from art hubs like the Brooklyn Museum and Andy Warhol Museum to institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh, Cornell, Columbia and Rutgers. They have a new self-produced album coming out Winter 2018.",

        "bio": "Low Cut Connie was recently called “the essence of what rock n roll should be” by Greg Kot (Sound Opinions / NPR)..and the New York Times has said “their live show is a phenomenon.”  They have been a rolling DIY caravan with an explosive live act bubbling under the surface of the music industry for 5 years, building an obsessive fanbase from all walks of life...white and black, straight and gay, young and old...salty lunatics of every persuasion.  Even former President Barack Obama is a fan. He chose their anthem of low-brow American life “Boozophilia” for his Spotify Playlist and met with Weiner at the White House in 2016.  \r\n\r\nBut with Dirty Pictures (part 1), Low Cut Connie moves beyond the drunken bar boogie they have become associated with into a deeper, darker, dirtier American life. \r\n\r\n“We’ve been thought of as a great party band by so many people, and we wear that as a badge of honor, but I really wanted to go deeper with this record.” Weiner said recently.  “We’ve been travelling this country now for a number of years, meeting people of all stripes, entertaining them in their bars and sleeping on their couches, laughing hard, holding them tight and sweating it out with them...I wrote this record really thinking about how people are feeling and living in this country these days.  It’s a wild scene out there.”\r\n\r\nAnd what is it that best brings Americans together in such wild and dirty times?  Weiner has a simple answer: “Rock n roll.  Nothing moves people more...it’ll make the most unsuspecting citizen hot, horny, angry, weepy and emotional and ultimately open to life like never before. I’ve seen it happen.  That’s what we do.  We change the molecules in the room.”   \r\n\r\nWhether they succeed or not, Low Cut Connie always attempts to make us feel something real, something very raw. With Dirty Pictures (part 1), this little rock n roll band from Philadelphia attempts to undress America, laughing and crying real tears with us all night long.",

Because of his dad’s job, his family moved 8 different times in 18 years before he finally achieved enough autonomy during his college years to settle down in Thousand Oaks, California. A list of the places Abhi’s lived reads like a travel blog’s wet dream: Madras, India to Beijing to Hong Kong to New Delhi back to Beijing back to New Delhi to the Fiji Islands to New Delhi again before arriving in Thousand Oaks, California. Throughout all his travels, he kept a certain set of songs with him, becoming the skeleton for his soon-to-be-released “Marbled”.",

It's a reflection of my love hate relationship with where I'm from and where I might go. It's a reflection of being raised by a mother who played piano in Mississippi Baptist Churches and a father who's main connection with me was a deep love for the blues. It’s the conflict of running away from your roots but finding a deeper love for them far away from home, and in the end learning so much more than I had ever dreamed of. It’s about laughing about all the dumbass shit that’s thrown your way all the damn time.\r\n\r\nI cannot remember a time in my life when I wasn't hooked on music and the way it made me feel. It has always been a medium to express my search for some peace, connection, humor and beauty within the constant fluctuations of life.  In the end…..it’s just really fun. —Thomas Johnson",

His first release \"Other Lover\" gathered mass attention by the house music community after appearing on Laurent Garnier's Resident Advisor Podcast (RA. 107) and John Digweed's Transitions Radio show. And so began Pezzner's lustrous dance music career, spinning off some 15 singles, countless remixes and 3 LP’s with Dirtybird, Get Physical, Crosstown Rebels, Visionquest, Strictly Rhythm and many, many more. \r\n\r\nPezzner's work could be said to be serious, with an abstract artistic sensibility, lofty percussive themes and intentions to create hypnotic soundscapes for the body as well as the brain. In 2015 Pezzner founded the boutique imprint, “Hunt & Gather” with a focus on left-field percussive rhythms and dance floor rarities. His “Native Language” project for Hunt & Gather was listed in Dixon’s Resident Advisor 500 year-end chart as one of the five most inspirational tracks of 2015.   His 2016 LP 'Title Track' on Get Physical is a 9-track walk-through the footholds of house, techno and ambient with a healthy touch of experimental where it counts. Beatportal wax lyrical how his music \"blows like a cool breeze through the stale air of a market crowded with by-the-numbers deep house\" and DMC World Magazine note how \"Dave Pezzner continues to re-define perceptions with his latest album.\" 5 Magazine describes Pezzner's productions as “future classics made for dance floors in the here and now.” \r\n\r\nLive shows and DJ sets abound not only in Europe, Pezzner has traveled across East Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe and South America moving the dance floors of some of the most beloved global venues and events including Dirtybird Campout, Space Ibiza, Fabric London, Womb Tokyo, Rex Club Paris, Output New York, Rio de Janeiro’s Sugar Loaf, and Chicago's famed Smartbar.\r\n\r\n“When it comes to eclecticism, few electronic musicians can replicate the sheer ingenuity that American producer David Pezzner invokes within his mosaic compositions. “ – The Electronic Beat \r\n\r\n“Strange noises, tropical bird chirps, and unintelligible voices wander in and out of the ethereal tones, all things tied together by one dope hand-drummed beat. It's alluring, to be sure, and it's perfect for Pezzner's first official release with Dirtybird Records.” - Billboard Magazine",

        "bio": "DACA is an immigration policy that allows some individuals who were brought to the United States as children and who remain undocumented, to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and be able to work or continue their education. Today, with the constant fear that this program will be terminated, these individuals are facing a harsh uncertainty about their futures and possible deportation. These speakers, in collaboration with PODER (Protecting Our Dreamers and Empowering Resilience), a local organization that advocates, supports, and works towards (clean) immigration reform, express their emotional experiences as DACA recipients in their stories that show their strength and overall resilience.  With over 3,000 DACA recipients in the state of Idaho, these are important stories to share as they give light to those experiences of people living in the shadows.\r\n\r\nDora Ramirez (Moderator):\r\n\r\nDora Ramirez is an Associate professor of Ethnic Literature at Boise State University, an early member of PODER, and comes from a family of fieldworkers. Her research focuses on ideas of nation-building, race relations within communities, how racial structures appear in literature and popular culture, and making literacy accessible to the working poor and Latinx populations. She is the author of Medical Fragmentation: Literary Modernism, Scientific Discourse, and the Mexican, Indigenous Body, 1870-1940s and her work appears in a variety of journals and collections. She holds a doctorate in Literature from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIrene Ruiz (Moderator and Co-founder of PODER):\r\n\r\nIrene Ruiz, M.A. is the daughter of Mexican Immigrants, Irene grew up in Hazelton, Idaho where she also worked in the fields with her family. Irene received her Master of Arts in Hispanic Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago and her Bachelor of Arts in Spanish from Boise State University.  Irene is one of the co-founders of PODER of Idaho. She started this non-profit organization to help DACA recipients in whatever is needed surrounding immigration issues. She hopes to be able to expand and help all immigration causes across the state of Idaho.\r\n\r\nBeth Almanza:\r\n\r\nElizabeth Almanza is a Boise State University student in the Masters of Social Work program. She received her undergraduate degree in Sociology with an emphasis in Criminal Justice and a Minor in Political Science. She has been an activist for intersectional feminism for six years now and in 2016 became a community organizer.  She has worked with PODER and Adelante SE Idaho where she has been actively advocating for immigrant’s rights. \r\n\r\nBrayan Vasquez:\r\n\r\nBrayan is one of many Boise natives that have grown up in the city of trees.  He’s a first generation student making a better brighter future for those around him.  He has been awarded highly competitive scholarships, he is a nationally recognized aspiring engineer in the works, and active community leader. Always ready to lend a helping hand and be the voice that his raza needs, he will always remain a servant leader, someone that puts his blood, sweat, and tears into enriching the lives of individuals, build better organizations, and ultimately create a more just and caring world. Being a DACA recipient himself, he understood at a young age, the limitations that he had compared to all of his peers, but he never let that stop him from achieving what he wanted most in his life, and he surely does not intend on slowing down anytime soon.  He loves taking all opportunities given to him as well as giving them back to others. When faced with everyday difficulties, he doesn’t just think outside the box, instead he destroys the box and rebuilds it more efficiently.\r\n\r\nMaria Santana:\r\n\r\nMaria was born in San Sebastian El Grande, Jalisco. She grew up in Nampa, ID. Maria is a legal assistant at an immigration law firm. As a DACA recipient Maria knows the struggle of being undocumented. Maria has been surrounded by a lot of nice, hardworking undocumented people. She loves working at an immigration law firm because she gets to help people make their dream come true when they are finally able to obtain legal status in the U.S. Maria would like to be able to continue with her education so one day she herself could become an immigration attorney.",

Artistic Director Lydia Sakolsky-Basquill has been taking part in a creative writing class, led by CSI instructor Shane Brown, among 10-15 ISCC inmates with the intention of creating work based on the writings of these inmates. The creative non-fiction writings touch on the inmates’ memories and experiences both in and out of prison. The project, which began in August 2017 has proven to be a rewarding, inspiring, and challenging experience for all involved in the process. For Treefort, Lydia and her dancers will allow the public to view Project Flux's live works and process, which will culminate in a performance in that same space, with pop up performances in various spaces to follow. The final work is set to debut at MING Studios June 2018.",

All that circuit wiring, as it turns out, is a harness for trapping delusions. \r\n\r\nThe band explores that revelation over the unresolved pop progressions of debut EP Big Lack, shrugging off the big dumb universe with a wry tunefulness. Tracked at Collins’s home studio amid tinkerings with a prototype electrode headband, the record leaks out of headphones like slow direct current.  \r\n\r\nMinihorse's genetic inheritance is a recombination of bedroom transistor wizards like Bob Pollard, cruising guitar rock into the outer valences of space in a shit-can convertible, and the brandied humor of Evan Dando and Alex Chilton, approaching the void with a pack of cigarettes. \r\n\r\nCooing sarcasm over a wallop of scuzzy power pop, Collins pokes at misfit notions of belonging or purpose with a Jason Lytle sigh. “Hollywood painted it black/Wait. Paint it back,” he jokes before the dam breaks on “Drink You Dry.”\r\n\r\nCollins and his fellow Ypsilanti yntroverts, bassist Christian Anderson and drummer John Fossum, are giddy with their musical contraptions. They scatter hooks like firecrackers on a blacktop throughout opener “Blueblack” and beat down doors with cool-headed kraut jam “Pinstripe Web.” \r\n\r\nWith breezy “Thriller”, Collins grips the tape reel, jerking the recording into warbled askew against a hummable fuzz bass counterpoint that coats the band’s keen insight: \r\n\r\n\"The thrill is not what's gone/It never was.\"",

        "bio": "um.. consists of two Icon Collective graduates, Ben Bruce and Dylan Gold, who met while at school and started making music together in 2014. Making music comes easy to the two who share a belief that there is a creative void in the electronic music space their music can fill. \r\n\r\n “We don’t want to follow an abused and over saturated path devoid of any creativity or evolution. We have found a direction that is new, fun and creatively unique, and have a strong collaborative workflow that comes naturally to us which we have found to be extremely rare. We have established a sound and brand that we believe is wholly representative of us as people and that can be understood and appreciated by anyone”.\r\n\r\n “This project has come together completely organically and we believe it is creatively innovative”. \r\n\r\num..’s first introduction to the public came in December of 2014 with their remix offering of much-hyped producer Awe’s “Griffin” being included in LA powerhouse collective Team Supreme’s Vol. 127 cypher. The guys were in great company grouped with Dubstep legend Plastician, King Henry, DJ Pound, Murphy, Lord Olaf, Rainoh Cee Ross, Yung Orca, Lost Midas, NuTrik Ruff Draft, and Nalepa.  Since then, um.. released their debut EP Pay Attention via New York based label Study Group, which peaked at #2 on the Beatport Electronica Album Chart and #12 on the overall album chart. Additionally, they have collaborated with Los Angeles based collective Shifty Rhythms where their track “skrillex” was featured in their Volume Three Compilation. \r\n\r\n“Our music has a playful feeling, while maintaining top level quality production, that’s refreshing in a time where producers take their music too seriously and sacrifice creativity for commercial sounding tracks. We are not interested in following any other artist’s path. We believe in creation without creative boundaries and we demonstrate that through our music.  Without saying anything more, I think the music speaks for itself”, says the duo.\r\n\r\nAfter a busy couple of years, including performances at NYC’s Webster Hall BASSment Saturday party, a midwest headline tour, LA’s Space Yacht and touring around the U.S., um.. is gearing up for an exciting year ahead.  “The unique brand of music that comes from um.. is unlike anything I’ve heard before.”  Says YourEDM.com, “There’s this weird magnetism that lies at the heart of every um.. track, and I can’t even begin to explain it.”\r\n",

As Moody wails and Seasons gently harmonizes behind her over twinkling synths and processed guitar, you can sense the audience holding their breath as the band was born. The songs of Haunted Summer are dreamy and hypnotic, rich with orchestral strings and sultry electronic textures. With their previous EP, Something in the Water, the group crafted a captivating, ethereal musical journey through a nostalgic world of young love and long-forgotten memories. Consisting of husband-and-wife Bridgette Moody and John Seasons, who share songwriting duties in a true collaboration, the Highland Park duo have shared the stage and toured with groups and performers including Taken By Trees, Islands, Deafheaven, The Polyphonic Spree, Coeur De Pirate, Olafur Arnalds, Carla Morrison, Meiko, Basia Bulat, Geographer, David J of Bauhaus and many more. Their new full-length, Spirit Guides, was written on the road as well as recorded in several studios including Rancho de la Luna in Joshua Tree, Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood, Comp-ny LA, and studios owned by Ninkasi Brewing in Eugene, Oregon. It features an array of talented musicians, including (but not limited to!) Dave Catching from Eagles of Death Metal and Chris Goss from Masters of Reality (both of whom are on the title track). Having completed multiple headlining tours across the country and a new 45 day tour to start 2018 off, Haunted Summer is poised to bring their psychedelic sound to the world.",

She can command the stage with soaring vocals while maintaining a vulnerability that will captivate you.\r\n\r\nMorris has been touring for a decade, initially playing under her own name in northern California. Longing for a change of pace, she moved to Portland, Oregon and formed the locally acclaimed band, Genders, with her friend Stephen Leisy. After winning a spot on Portland's Best New Band list in 2013 and multiple tours with indie rock legends, Built to Spill... Morris decided to add a solo project into the mix. Exploring the more personal side of her dynamic songwriting, Sunbathe came to formation in the fall of 2014.",

Despite being anchored by the often anachronistic accordion, the music ends up having less to do with contemporary purveyors of old world idioms, and more to do with an alternate history—one where angular accordion lines take prominence over the guitar in a nervy and strangely cinematic post-punk tradition.",

His mixes, remixes and dubs are known for their sass, energy and wickedly wry samples that snap like a wet towel to the face, but his original tracks are where his efforts shine, like those released with Justin Martin-“Mr. Spock,” a 2010 party anthem charted by Diplo and Jesse Rose, and “Lezgo,” charted by Dog Blood (Skrillex and Boyz Noise)-and those soon-to-be-released on his own EP with Dirtybird. It’s no wonder he’s been given the nod by everyone from Papa Dirtybird himself (Claude Von Stroke) and A-Trak to those who are charting his remixes, like Maya Jane Coles, Audiojack, and Riva Starr, the last of whom he has an upcoming remix for to be released on Snatch. The greatest strength in Ardy’s music is his ability to whip out hits that work equally well from the dankest basements to the most opulent dancefloors; sounds that satisfy those with diverse tastes who can unite under his single agenda of having a good time.",

He straddles multiple musical worlds and belongs to none, now nearly 20 years into his kaleidoscopic career, with five albums and two dozen EPs plus millions of miles in the rearview of his biography.\r\n\r\nDear kicked off 2017 as a selector, DJing regularly and contributing a deeply considered and personal mix to !K7 Records' long established DJ-Kicks series. This was bookended by a number of releases through his techno guise, Audion. Dear hadn't shared material under his own name since his 2012 LP, the multi-colored Beams, which was preceded by the critically acclaimed avant-pop albums Black City, Asa Breed, and Leave Luck To Heaven. This return to his artistic id, apart from his other projects' egos, makes \"Modafinil Blues\" momentous, a prodigal shift inward to a dark and playful psyche.",

        "bio": "Holiday Friends' third album, Night Terrors, is one of the group’s strongest efforts to date. The new album finds the group honing their already razor sharp pop hooks while embracing moodier, darker elements. Take a song like “Heyday,” which boasts a fist-pumping chorus and throwback ‘80s synth pulses that seems ripe for Top 40 radio, but is cut through with lyrics that by turns abstract and direct. Or “Loaded Gun,” a song that builds slowly on a bed of programmed rhythms and throbbing bass lines that would make Nine Inch Nails proud, then kept aloft by airy vocals and glistening atmospherics. \r\n\r\nNight Terrors marks a huge leap forward for Holiday Friends, and one that should help continue the momentum that they’ve been gathering in recent years. They’re always a welcome draw in Portland, where they’ve sold out clubs like Doug Fir Lounge and Mississippi Studios, and been invited to open up for artists like Vampire Weekend, Bastille, and The Vaccines. The album will only add an extra bit of wind in their sails as they look toward more shows and touring through 2017, and, with their lineup now secure, an even stronger future together.",

        "bio": "After establishing a sound on their debut Voyage and establishing an identity with the revelatory Generation, L.A. disco-not-disco duo De Lux took a moment to re-center and come back leaner, sharper, clearer and deeper on their new More Disco Songs About Love. Now that co-founders Sean Guerin and Isaac Franco know how to play and what to say, they’re ready to just get lost in the music. As the band puts it: “We like to say Voyage was our baby, Generation was our baby all grown up and More Disco Songs About Love thinks growing up sucks and just wants to party smart.  \r\n\r\nTheir 2014 debut Voyage revealed De Lux as an outfit matching post-punk sentiment and the-sociopolitical-is-personal perspective to joyfully indulgent analog synthesizer soundscapes and a deliriously transportive musical joy. 2015’s Generation added an almost-documentary aspect to their dance music, delivering clearly personal stories of anxiety and aspiration. And 2015 also saw their first major festival appearance at Bonnaroo, the prelude to their hotly tipped Coachella debut in 2016 and then sharing a bill with Arcade Fire at New York City’s Panorama fest.\r\n\r\nNow More Disco Songs is a stream-of-consciousness tour through De Lux’s reality. (With New York City dance-punk legend Sal P. of Liquid Liquid and the Pop Group’s maniacal Mark Stewart as guests, of course.) Though the title might seem like some kind of clever reference, it’s really simple and direct. The disco is the sound—in the most innovative way, of course—and the love is the sentiment: “It's all literal to us but we realize that it might not be for others,” they say. “We like the idea of giving listeners something to question. But there's love in there.”",

        "bio": "Chief Broom is the brainchild of local musician and artist Shadrach Tuck. The music of Chief Broom is an eclectic amalgamation of post-punk tendencies while still drawing from grunge, fusing rock soundscapes juxtaposed with jazz harmony and even atonal moments. As if Modest Mouse, Interpol and Jeff Buckley were in a car wreck with \"Bitches Brew\" Era Miles Davis. \r\nShad is most commonly known for his work locally as member of SLYMOONSUTRA and local jazz group Trio Skgeddit. He has also performed extensively as the former bassist of Zack Quintana and the Tucks. He has opened for artists including Victor Wooten, Thundercat, Built to Spill, and iLOVEMAKONNEN and performed in venues throughout the Pacific Northwest.\r\nChief Broom has remained his outlet for self reflection and catharsis, stemming from early songwriting in high school at the age of 16. The primary inspiration of the music is a reflection of developmental periods in life and the frustrations that interweave them.",

The project has metamorphosed endlessly over the last ten years with an endless revolving cast of members who help the recordings come to life where Trudeau couldn't otherwise have pulled it off. \r\nQuite simply, in an ideal world this music would be deemed \"Collage Pop\" if summarized.

        "bio": "Infernal Coil is an extreme metal band based in Boise, Idaho. While the band's sonic and lyrical expression is most easily classified as metal, it's not confined to any limitations. The band's 2014 demo, \"Burning Prayer of Infinite Hatred,\" gave listeners a glimpse into the fury and dissonance it delves into. The new LP, \"Within A World Forgotten,\" continues on that path, but also explores more complex, enchanting boundaries. The musical dichotomy speaks to Infernal Coil's conceptual themes of the natural world's paradoxes, contrasting the beauty and chaos of nature, as well as humankind's seemingly inevitable self-destruction. Infernal Coil's presentation transcends fantasy, instead reflecting a fascination with mammoth concepts based in reality -- a genuine expression of horror and awe. Careful listeners will recognize Infernal Coil's similarity to founding member Folús' previous project, Dead in the Dirt, but don't mistake it for a continuation. Infernal Coil stands on its own two feet in its artistic expression, breaking barriers we only set for ourselves.",

Their dynamic live performances include a backdrop of glitched-out and well-worn VHS videos while their music caters to audiophiles and dance club enthusiasts alike. Their newest album, Metatransit, is a journey through the dark, dystopian, retrofuture of the Purge Worlds comic book; a story that follows the cybernetic assassin Brandon Lao from planet to planet as he seeks revenge for the death of his partner Anna. Musically, Metatransit guides you through a world of retro-tech aesthetic and glitched-out soundscapes that wax and wane from dystopian ambiance to punchy dance-floor pop.",

DOLAN have finally caved to years of fan pressure to form an official group: EPIC BEARD MEN. The super-duo embraced the absurd name as a reminder to themselves that, while they tackle a lot of difficult subject matter in their solo work, this group’s mission boils down to one thing: “This is supposed to be fun, for fuck’s sake.”\r\n \r\nSTRANGE FAMOUS RECORDS released their “WAR ON CHRISTMAS” single for free last December as a teaser of what the team has in store for the new year, and made it crystal clear that these two are not just here to discuss personal grooming; The EPIC BEARD MEN are gunning for a spot among your favorite partnerships in music. The stockpile of songs they’ve been meticulously obsessing over for last 2+ years feature Francis and Dolan tackling a vast array of concepts and trading off some of the most sardonic, punchy, and fun lyrics you’re likely to hear in 2018. \r\n\r\nThe “SEASON 1” EP contains 8 songs and will be released in late February. The collection is stacked with a signature blend of dusty breaks and absurdist lyrics, infectious grooves and slapping snares, plus the effortless rapport of two of indie rap’s best passing the baton back and forth with the only other emcee capable of running this rap race at such a breakneck pace. EBM’s full-length debut album is slated to drop in October. In the interim, fans can expect videos, remixes, social media meltdowns, and lots...’o...touring.",

        "bio": "The act of starting a garden is akin to healing. Catharsis, and the process of tilling your emotional beds, is not finite. The momentary respite, and allowing oneself to be absorbed in the act, is a salve. But winter comes, the garden shifts, and you begin anew. Haley Heynderickx’s debut album, 'I Need to Start a Garden', is a translation of this unabating flux of life.\r\n\r\nFor Heynderickx, reasons abound for seeking understanding through songwriting. Growing up in a religious household in Oregon while closely identifying with her Filipino roots, she embodies multiple cultural identities and the paradoxes inherent therein. Now residing in Portland, her faith is not overt, but her introspection and continued struggle for self-actualization are at the forefront of her accessible, poignant songs.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the tracks on 'I Need to Start a Garden' reflect these seemingly disparate elements. With Heynderickx’s arresting vocal delivery, deft guitar and accented trombone sighs ranging from subtle to blunt, her music defies an easy identification. From the captivating doo-wop inspired “Oom Sha La La”; to \"Worth It\", the building, energetic, 8-minute long ode to finding, and holding onto, your confidence; to \"Untitled God Song\", an entrancing rumination on spirituality; 'I Need To Start A Garden' is replete with the distinct facets of what makes Haley Heynderickx one of the most anticipated artists coming out of Portland right now.\r\n\r\n'I Need to Start a Garden' is relatable in how it speaks to the odious realities we attempt to confront daily, accompanied by a heavy dose of self-reflection. Heynderickx knows your pain -- she speaks to it in no uncertain terms through her personal expositions, entwining her healing process with yours.\r\n\r\nThe album was produced and mixed by Zak Kimball at Nomah Studios in Portland. It features Lily Breshears (Shears) on keys and backing vocals; Denzel Mendoza on trombone; Phillip Rogers (Alexandra Savior) on drums; and Tim Sweeney on upright bass. I Need to Start a Garden will be released March 2nd, 2018 by Mama Bird Recording Co.",

When he wasn’t frivolously playing with words, he earned credits in such meaningful courses as Trampoline, Juggling, and Seventeenth Century Italian Longsword. These dubious decisions notwithstanding, he regrets nothing and now holds degrees in English and education with certificates in creative writing and folklore.\r\n\r\nHe currently teaches high school language arts, including reading and writing, mythology and heroes. He is a proud husband and father. When reading aloud, he always does the voices.\r\n\r\nJackaby is his first novel. It was born in the middle of the night and written on two different hemispheres. It has survived typhoons and hurricanes and was fostered into publication through the patient care of many hands. Beastly Bones is his second novel.",

Known for “endearingly loose” guitar-rock (San Jose Metro) and wall-of-sound live shows, their second studio album finds the band expanding their references. The eponymous LP draws on decades of rock-and-roll as broad ranging as guitar tones lifted from 1960's psychedelia and folk rock; the concept albums of 1970’s art rock and an up-front, sometimes aggressive vocal delivery reminiscent of early 2000’s indie rock.\r\n\r\nSun Valley Gun Club, LP, has been hailed as “nuanced and innovative” (SF Deli), and “shifting and complex” (Sacramento News and Review). Lyrically the songs are narratives inspired by film, classic Science Fiction, and the Bible, without being \"buried in symbolism. It sounds like a person making sense of life.\" (Submerge) It is a record about cultural and religious fixation on the apocalypse, self-fulfilling prophecy, Will Smith, and the imperative of people to forgive, if not their loved ones, then at least themselves.",

His songs are a collection from growing up in a small town in Idaho with all of the hardships and beauty of living in small town America, to five years living in a shoebox apartment off Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles CA, then to traveling and living on the road playing 250 shows a year. Though recently making the move to Nashville TN, Jeff continues to spend majority of his time touring the country. \r\n\r\nAfter spending the last two years splitting his time between playing guitar for Widespread Panic song-writer Jerry Joseph and performing with his own band, Jeff hit the studio to produce his fourth full length album, Postcards from Magdalena. The collection of songs was inspired by the places and cultures Crosby experienced while traveling across the U.S., Iceland, the UK., Colombia, Nicaragua, and Alaska. \r\nProduced and engineered by Gregg Williams (Dandy Worhals, Blitzen Trapper, Pete Droge, Jesse Malin), Postcards from Magdalena is set to release October 27th, released by UK label At The Helm Records.",

It took a surprise poetry class with a high school arts program for Jamila to finally find her metaphorical and literal voice. “Through poetry, I realized you are the expert of your own experience,” she says. \r\n\r\nHer poetry studies continued in college and in her professional career with Young Chicago Authors. Music–like poetry– is personal. “It became a way to stop hiding, to actually be the most honest with myself through writing,” she says. “It helps me check in with myself.” And that honesty translated to HEAVN, an album she describes as a collection of, “nontraditional love songs pushing the idea of what makes a love song.” \r\n\r\nYou’ll find the bits and pieces of her past and present that make Jamila: family, the city of Chicago, self-care, and the black women she calls friends.\r\n\r\nJamila is an artist of substance creating music crafted with a sturdy foundation of her passions and influences. True and pure in its construction and execution, her music is the best representation of Jamila herself: strong in her roots, confident in her ideas, and attuned to the people, places and things shaping her world.",

        "bio": "Vancouver, B.C., has always been a musical town. But back in The Day, as far as sizzling, soulful funk, it was something of a desert … until some mysterious force drew two young cats together who would change that in a hurry.\r\n\r\nFrom their first house party jams, drummer Tayo Branston and guitarist Gabe Boothroyd gathered a community of musicians who shared their love for James Brown, Tower Of Power, Tito Puente, Antibalas, Frank Zappa and other adventurous groove-driven players. They called themselves Five Alarm Funk, drew more than 300 fans to their first gig at a local place called The Fairview Pub, established a residency at Richards On Richards where upwards of 800 attendees would show up each night -- and eventually embarked on a 37-day, cross-continental track involving 30 shows from Vancouver to Fredericton.\r\n\r\nSince then they’ve expanded their territory to include the U.S., played as far afield as Taiwan, rocked the Riverbend Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and begun releasing EPs and CDs. The most recent of these, 2017’s Sweat, explodes with fiery rhythms, punchy horns and gang-chant vocals that sum up the irresistible essence of this band.\r\n\r\nThey’re now deep into a new project that involves adding all-star guest vocals onto some of the more volatile tracks from their catalog, beginning with a Bootsy Collins appearance. “I’ve been a Bootsy Collins fan ever since I was 15,” Branston marvels. “That track we gave him, ‘Capital City,’ is one of the funkiest things we’ve ever cut. With that experience and our back catalog, you’ll see a lot more of this from us.”\r\n\r\nFuture releases and reissues with big-time rappers and funksters. Sights set on bringing their magic to festivals throughout the world. More sweat, more dancing … more Five Alarm Funk.",

        "bio": "MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN\r\n“Having this identity—radical indigenous queer feminist—keeps me going. My music and my identity come from the same foundation of being a Native woman.” Katherine Paul is Black Belt Eagle Scout, and after releasing an EP in 2014 Paul has wrapped up the band’s first full-length. Recorded in the middle of winter near her hometown in Northwest Washington, the landscape’s eerie beauty and Paul’s connection to it are palpable on Mother of My Children. Stemming from this place, the album traces the full spectrum of confronting buried feelings and the loss of what life was supposed to look like. \r\n\r\nGrowing up on a small Indian reservation, Paul’s family was focused on native drumming, singing, and arts. “Native American music is the foundation for all of my music,” Paul explains. With the support of her family and a handful of bootleg Hole and Nirvana VHS tapes, Paul taught herself how to play guitar. In 2007, Paul moved to Portland, OR, to attend school and get involved with the Rock ’n’ Roll Camp for Girls. Paul has switched between guitar and drums in an assortment of projects over the last decade, citing Forest Park as a particularly strong influence on how her songwriting has grown. “It was my introduction to post-rock,” Paul recalls, “From there, I was able to develop my own sound and style more.”\r\n\r\nOn Mother of My Children, Black Belt Eagle Scout tenderly blends post-rock with Paul’s earlier grunge influences and later, more confessional Pacific Northwest artists like Ô Paon and Mirah. The album begins with the singles “Soft Stud” and “Indians Never Die”, and on the latter, Paul’s message is clear: “It’s a call out to colonizers and those who don’t respect the Earth; they don’t care about the water, they don’t care about how they are destroying what is around them. Indigenous people are the protectors of this land, and others need to wake up and get on the same page.” The songs weave together to capture both the enduring and fleeting experiences of loss, frustration, and dreaming. The structures are traditional, but the lyrics don’t adhere to any format other than what feels right in the moment. “I don’t play music to write songs,” Paul explains, “I play music to process feelings, and sometimes what comes out of that is a song.” Paired with Paul’s clear and measured voice, each song leaves the listener feeling as if they were there when the song was written, the immediate, candid emotion tangible.\r\n\r\nMother of My Children is a life chapter gently preserved, and the access listeners have to such vulnerability feels special and generous. We are left wanting more, and all signs point to Black Belt Eagle Scout just getting started. The album is out on Good Cheer Records in August 2017.\r\n\r\n—Alex Hebler",

On her last outing, Bury Me Into the Mtn, she has created an album that is structurally complicated, while also sparse and open, full of warmth and light. Her chord progressions, rhythms and melodies draw as much from Appalachia as they do from jazz. Her lyrics are as cryptic as they are simple and straightforward. The album’s sonic landscape is completely its own.  Eleanor Murray has spent the last twelve years playing and recording music out of Olympia, WA. Her five albums have spanned a wide range of material and her side projects extend this range even further, currently with the electro-pop production of Cavegreen.",

        "bio": "On his 2011 debut 'Will The Guns Come Out,' Hanni El Khatib tried something he'd never tried before -- making a bedroom-style recording of his then stripped-to-the-skeleton guitar-and-drums rock 'n' roll mostly for the sheer joy of making it. For his ferocious 2013 follow-up 'Head In The Dirt,' he tried something new again, showing up at producer Dan Auerbach's analog-dreamland Nashville studio with nothing but the clothes on his back and an open mind.\r\n\r\nBut after 'Head In The Dirt''s release and almost a year of relentless touring, Hanni knew he needed to go past 'unpredictable' all the way to 'unprecedented.' He needed isolation, time and the chance to experiment. So after 30 days locked in hand-picked L.A. studio The Lair, the result is the album 'Moonlight' -- the rarest and most welcome kind of album, made at that perfect point in life where confidence, experience, and technique unite to help an artist do anything they want.\r\n\r\nThat's why it starts with a song that sounds like a Mobb Deep beat under a Suicide-style synth drone and ends with an ESG-meets-LCD Soundsystem gone italo-disco song about life and death. That's why it collides crushing crate-digger drumbeats that'd be right at home on a Can LP or an Eddie Bo 45 with bleeding distorto guitar, bent and broken barroom piano and hallucinatory analog flourishes. (In fact, some smart producer is going to sample the drums from this album and complete the circle of life.) And that's also why 'Moonlight' feels like the album he's always wanted to make: \"What would it sound like if RZA got in the studio with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits?\" he asks. \"I don't know! That was my approach on everything.\"\r\n\r\nIt's a personal album in the most primal sense, put together in any way that worked. Iggy Pop and David Bowie did this kind of thing on 'The Idiot,' the Wu-Tang Clan did it on '36 Chambers' and the Clash did it three times over on 'Sandinista.' And now it's Hanni's turn, across 11 new lightning-struck songs, each written and recorded in its own flash of inspiration. It sounds like an album made by an endless list of collaborators, but really 'Moonlight' was more like the first do-it-almost-all-yourself music Hanni ever made, except after six years recording and touring, he'd learned to do so much more.",

        "bio": "For Lauren Ross, it took multiple breakdowns, lots of physical therapy, anti-depressants, and a move across the country before the clouds began to part, the music began to come, and La Louma emerged. On her debut, Let The World Be Flooded Out, she explores heavy subject matter in an upbeat atmosphere, merging her classical training with her DIY queer punk ethos.\r\n\r\nMeticulously handcrafted over hundreds of hours of solitude, La Louma’s palette includes thickly melodic woodwinds and brass, electric guitar and bass, impatient drums, tremolo vocal undercurrents, and metaphor-laden lyrics. The LP’s tone repeatedly shifts unexpectedly from dramatic desperation to quiet contemplation, from a determined sprint to utter immobilization. Musically mirroring La Louma’s vagabond mind, each of the album’s richly transportive scenes are colored by carefully chosen modalities, timbres, instrumentations, and arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe opening track “The Decline of Nations” crashes through as a fist-raising call to “stay until you try to make things right”. As La Louma’s voice wails and breaks into a pointed and beautiful howl, it feels as though she could be singing to government officials, movement leaders, or even herself. Falling drum sticks and a slinking clarinet introduce \"Candy\", a mythology-driven song in which she vows to protect a narcissist from drowning in their own reflection—no matter the cost—while the more straightforward storytelling of the subtly Middle Eastern tinged \"Just Wanna Love You\" culminates in symphonic catharsis. The album's sonic anchor, \"Tin Roof Now\", makes use of nearly every instrument in La Louma's studio as she pleads for the simple sound of a heavy rain to \"drown out [her] senses\" and \"let the world be flooded out\".\r\n\r\nThis album is a thematic whirlwind with a musical hurricane to match, but isn’t that what life often feels like?",

        "bio": "For over a decade, Nika Roza Danilova has been recording music as Zola Jesus. She's been on Sacred Bones Records for most of that time, and Okovi marks her reunion with the label.\r\n\r\nFittingly, the 11 electronics-driven songs on Okovi share musical DNA with her early work on Sacred Bones. The music was written in pure catharsis, and as a result, the sonics are heavy, dark, and exploratory. In addition to the contributions of Danilova's longtime live bandmate Alex DeGroot, producer/musician WIFE, cellist/noise-maker Shannon Kennedy from Pedestrian Deposit, and percussionist Ted Byrnes all helped build Okovi's textural universe.\r\n\r\nWith Okovi, Zola Jesus has crafted a profound meditation on loss and reconciliation that stands tall alongside the major works of its genre. The album peaks of tragedy with great wisdom and clarity. Its songs plumb dark depths, but they reflect light as well.\r\n\r\nARTIST STATEMENT:\r\n\r\nLast year, I moved back to the woods in Wisconsin where I was raised. I built a little house just steps away from where my dilapidated childhood tree fort is slowly recombining into earth. Okovi was fed by this return to roots and several very personal traumas.\r\n\r\nWhile writing Okovi, I endured people very close to me trying to die, and others trying desperately not to. Meanwhile, I was fighting through a haze so thick I wasn't sure I'd find my way to the other side. Death, in all of its masks, has been encircling everyone I love, and with it the questions of legacy, worth, and will.\r\n\r\nOkovi is a Slavic word for shackles. We're all shackled to something -- to life, to death, to bodies, to minds, to illness, to people, to birthright, to duty. Each of us born with a unique debt, and we have until we die to pay it back. Without this cost, what gives us the right to live? And moreover, what gives us the right to die? Are we really even free to choose?\r\n\r\nThis album is a deeply personal snapshot of loss, reconciliation, and a sympathy for the chains that keep us all grounded to the unforgiving laws of nature. To bring it to life, I decided to enlist the help of Alex DeGroot, who has been the only constant in my live band and helped mix the Stridulum EP back in 2010. It will be released on Sacred Bones, the closest group of people I'll ever have to blood-bound family.",

The 20-minute ode to love “Dearest” was released in 2017 on hot-ticket tape label Gaylord’s Party Music. Currently a collaborative project with songwriters Sara Gallagher, Jeremie Rüest, Taylor Giffin and Gray Tolhurst, they are touring and performing songs from an as yet unannounced LP. The group’s performances are highlighted by its dreamy landscape of sound, Stoesz and Gallagher’s lush melodies and harmonies, and ever-so-slightly wobbly grooves. \r\n\r\nWilliam Q. Funk\r\n\r\nPraise for Gentle Spirit\r\n\r\nOne could be forgiven for thinking Stoesz had been recording music for decades, in terms of scope and depth, but the remarkable thing is how young he is; it's clear he's just getting started.\r\nDo The Bay\r\n\r\nGentle Spirit has a calm reservation that is a signature of confidence and understanding of ones own sound.

Formed in 2015, Wild Spells began as a duo called We Are Apes, with Erin Nelson, keyboardist and vocalist, and Eric Larson, guitarist and vocalist, in a single-room recording studio. In early 2016, the band expanded to four members, adding drummer Kory Parsley and bassist Zack Evans. In late 2017, the band changed their name to Wild Spells to better reflect the direction their music has taken as a four-piece ensemble, featuring shifts between quiet intensity and large, booming choruses. \r\n\r\nWild Spells explores topics spanning the nature of femininity, our tense political atmosphere, religion, identity, intimacy, heartbreak, and much more. The band's first EP, titled Half-Dead Moon, debuts in May 2018.",

I wanted to explore the questions: What does a person become if they don't know where they came from? What is the essential quality of the person if you strip away all memory?\" explains singer/songwriter Kyle Morton.\r\n\r\nOfferings is divided into four movements (Floodplains, Flood, Reckoning, and Afterparty) to represent the mental phases the main character goes through where he first realizes that something is wrong, then struggles through the chaos of his situation, and finally moves into acceptance before succumbing to his dreadful fate.",

After years behind the drum kit for frequent collaborators Joshua James and Desert Noises, Timmy The Teeth has now emerged as a unique voice at the forefront of the Utah music scene. Drawing from a tradition that spans a great deal of the traditional American songbook, Timmy has created his own brand of “outlaw.” Keeping a lighthearted confidence while singing about the kinds of things we're all thinking but not saying. Recorded in his hometown of American Fork, UT, Timmy The Teeth's latest release, Ain't That Bad (Aug '17), was produced and co-written with Joshua James, and offers a bold, humorous, and hooky follow up to TtT's debut LP, Just Another Day.",

Described by Clash Music as “a true cosmonaut of inner space,” the new album explores different regions of Mockasin’s singular galaxy, guided by his truly adventurous songwriting that favors reconfigured pop structures with a skewed funk sensibility. If Caramel wasn’t enough, Mockasin has also been writing more material for Charlotte Gainsbourg after penning the exquisite “Out Of Touch” for the actress/singer’s 2012 mini-album, Stage Whisper. It’s another sign that Mockasin is going places, but at his own pace – just as Caramel suggests the process of melting and taking on a new shape, a new taste. That is the true sound of Connan Mockasin.",

        "bio": "Los Angeles-band Moaning is the abrasive post-punk trio comprised of Sean Solomon, Pascal Stevenson, and Andrew MacKelvie.  The three initially met as teenagers while growing up in the San Fernando Valley, and immediately developed a kinship through Los Angeles’s local music scene. The three began regularly frequenting DIY institutions like The Smell and Pehrspace, eventually selling out dozens of their shows at both venues with their first few bands.\r\n\r\nFrom the sentimental to catastrophic, hiding meek and introspective lyrics within powerful droning dance songs, the music Moaning makes also gives sonic nods to some of the band’s musical heroes like New Order, Broadcast, and Slowdive. \r\n\r\nMoaning’s fervent songs are born out of the member’s experiences with love and distress, creating a sound uniquely dark and sincere. This is evidenced in the band’s early version (and video) of their track, “The Same.” The three went into their home studio to record the song and subsequently decided to shoot a music video for the track. Moaning was tipped off about a house that was about to be demolished nearby, and had quickly assembled a group of friends and filmed them taking turns destroying the estate. Meanwhile, Solomon, Stevenson, and MacKelvie tried their best to perform the song amongst the chaos. The video’s budget was limited to the sledgehammers, spray paint, and a case of beer they provided for the friends who were invited to cause havoc, which emphasizes Moaning’s desire to make as much impact with as few resources as possible. The track’s skidding percussion and toned back vocals gave merely a glimmer of the target Moaning aimed to hit with their sound.",

Their forward-thinking sound combines synthesizers, drum machines, live percussion, and entrancing harmonies to create an unmistakable fusion of R&B, synth-pop, and electronic music. St. Juste and Ehara are joined by four remarkable bandmates to create their multidimensional music: drummer Chris Thalmann, keyboard/synth player Mahesh Rao, percussionist Mirza Kopelman, and sampler Kumar Butler. They take inspiration from across the musical spectrum; their individual influences range from recognizable artists (Erykah Badu, Jai Paul, James Blake, Radiohead, and Broadcast) to genres and eras that don’t initially appear to fit together (hip hop, indie rock, early electronica, and 70’s dub). Their unique alchemy of seemingly disparate sounds has led fans and critics alike to describe the band as defying categorization.",

        "bio": "DJ Gladwell has been obsessed with hip-hop music since the early 80’s and began tinkering with djing and beat-making during his college years in the 90’s. After moving to Boulder Colorado in 2001, surrounded by world-class record stores and a thriving local hip-hip music scene, his obsession for progressive indie-rap/electronic music became ignited like high-grade explosives. Gladwell met some talented young high school kids and formed the Crew known as the Whiskey Blanket. DJ Gladwell was spinning regularly around Boulder, making beats and building friendships with the many underground rap groups who regularly toured through town, right up to the moment where he was run over in the street by a speeding BMW. Faced with major leg and spinal injuries and what would be over a year-long recovery, Gladwell had no other option but to move back to Boise to recuperate in his parents home. While recovering, Gladwell noticed that none of the amazing touring hip-hop acts who were performing every week in Colorado, were doing shows in Boise. That is when he decided that instead of moving back to Boulder, he would stay in Boise and devote his energies to the goal of trying to bring more independent touring hip-hop acts to town. If you were, for example, one of the 28 people who saw Heiroglyphics play at the Blues Bouquet in 2005, you probably know DJ Gladwell. Gladwell has performed on-stage with countless underground rap groups, toured with Pharcyde and Josh Martinez, has produced a beat or two and while he might not be the BEST DJ in Boise... or even the 5th best... he does have an amazing record collection and when he takes the time to put together a set... it can be pretty dope.",

Fronted by the bouffant wearing vocalist Leeni Queeno, the group includes two electric guitar players (the eerie Ben Von Wildenhaus and prodigious Jason Goessl), bassist (Birch Pereira), saxophonist (Jon Sampson), drummer (Tom Meyers) and a duo of drag queen backup singers (Joelle and Evonne). \r\n\r\nWhile tracks from the band have been featured in outlets like IndieWire, KEXP 90.3 FM, and Seattle’s City Arts magazine, Prom Queen’s latest release, “Doom-Wop,” is the group’s most complete and acclaimed album. A theatrical record featuring songs about going blonde, the end of the world, mania and loneliness, the work is brought to life when Prom Queen takes the stage. Imbuing qualities of haunted Americana, Prom Queen, very much in the lineage of John Waters and Twin Peaks, shows that they’re equal parts nostalgia and numinous mystery.",

Chief among the standard-bearers is Built To Spill.” – Associated Press\r\n\r\n“… As if no one ever doubted the beauty of a long, slow-building solo…Doug Martsch applies his high voice and his earnest intelligence to songs that address both his private conflicts and his political convictions.”  -- The New York Times\r\n\r\nBuilt To Spill have proven they are most certainly built to last.” – Nylon\r\n\r\n“Subtly excellent an obviously influential. If you’re not excited about Built To spill, you’re living in the past.” – Magnet Magazine\r\n\r\n“The Boise, Idaho band has filled the space where flannel meets Birkenstocks. Their jangly head trips placed them somewhere between Sonic Youth and Luna on the indie-rock circuit, but they’ve also wooed Deadheads…Unique, virtuosic musicianship.”  -- Spin",

Songs like \"Be Here Now\" and \"Friends\" accentuate the social complexities of living in the public sphere, while such songs as \"Way It Was\" and \"Nothing to Lose\" tip their hat to nostalgia, but only as a starting point to grow and learn from.\r\nTheir sound is part acoustic folk and part shoe-gaze rock - with elements of honky-tonk thrown in to keep you dancing. As an album, \"Better Neighbor\" flows like a bouncing brook; but it may be hard to compartmentalize their sound into a certain genre. Fortunately, they have done this for you and proudly state that Grayson County Burn Ban plays \"Campfire Country Rock\".",

Tyto’s founding members Melanie Steinway and Matt Rossi, after meeting at a singer-songwriter showcase, breathed life into the band as Steinway’s former folk outfit dissolved. They were later joined by long-time friends Danny DiMarchi and Andrew Bair, to complete the band’s current lineup. Tyto Alba self-released their sophomore EP, 'In Our Own Time', in March of 2017.",

Eldren won Best Psych Rock Band in Denver two years in a row for the 2016 and 2015 Westword Music Awards, and they have been nominated five times for Best Band in Denver by iHeartRADIO (KTCL 93.3 in Denver) for the Hometown for the Holidays and Big Gig contests.  Their latest album, Welcome to Deathville (2015), made the Colorado Public Radio OpenAir Best Albums of 2015 Listener Poll, and it was given a perfect album review score (\"5 out of 5 Cocks\") in Rooster Magazine.\r\n\r\nEldren headlines sold out shows in Denver and their genre-bending style allows them to play with a diverse range of musicians.  They have played shows with Gene Ween, OK Go, The Black Angels, Imagine Dragons, Dr. Dog, Cold War Kids, Mother Mother, Cursive, MarchFourth Marching Band, Dan Deacon, and many more.\r\n\r\nPraise for Eldren:\r\n\r\n\"A psychedelic dream rock super pop soundgasm that will grip your eyes and ears and leave you trembling with a sense of wonder and want.\"\r\n—Westword Magazine\r\n\r\n\"Eldren, a self-proclaimed 'psychedelic space pop' outfit, represents everything great still left in the world.\"\r\n—Brian Frederick (Rooster Magazine)\r\n\r\n\"With a panoply of conventional and not-so-conventional instruments on stage, Eldren draws plenty of attention before the band ever plays a note. Once the group starts playing, it becomes clear that it’s more than just a feast for the eyes. The ensemble’s mashup of jazz, prog rock, jam, power pop, indie rock and more makes for a joyful noise that would be utterly chaotic if it weren’t so damned catchy.\"\r\n—Eryc Eyl (Denver Post)",

        "bio": "\"Deviant Kin has become something of a Boise institution.  Fronted by multi-instrumentalist and Renaissance man Steve Baker and featuring a line up of Boise's most talented musicians, Deviant Kin has something for everyone.  Genre bending and original, they seamlessly move through the musical landscape ranging from the bluegrass of the Appalachians to songs that bring up thoughts of the Basque country.  A uniquely Idaho band, Deviant Kin sings Irish folk songs that get the crowd roused and brings it back home with humor celebrating what's best about this state.  Blistering fiddle lines meld with clean banjo rolls held together by one of Boise's tightest rhythm sections.  Deviant Kin will surprise some, impress many, and may even inspire you to become one with your inner shepherd.  Go check them out!\"\r\n--Radio DJ Willy Dallas, Host of the AM Breakdown on Radio Boise\r\n\r\n\"You guys went from Cuban to Zydeco to Celtic to Uncle Tupelo, I had no idea what the hell you were going to pull out next!\" This was overheard after DK's set at Treefort last year.  \r\nThis group of musicians is out to rouse the crowd with originals and interpretations of tunes that veer wildly through their sets-- made up of Garrett Finley on cajon and percussion, Micah Deffries on lead guitar, Tony Lemmon making the fiddle sing and Ryan Blizzard solid in the pocket on that big doghouse bass.  Steve Baker and Garr formed DK years ago in a moldy airstream trailer on the back 40, and since then have moved a little beyond their original goal of bluegrass Rush covers...thank goodness. Veterans of Live after five and Treefort and many a beautiful backyard wedding, Deviant Kin is down to play!",

His fifth, DON’T SKIP OUT ON ME, is due out in February 2018.\r\n\r\nVlautin founded the band Richmond Fontaine in 1994. The band produced eleven studio albums, plus a handful of live recordings and EPs. Driven by Vlautin’s dark, story-like songwriting, the band, now retired, achieved critical acclaim at home and across the UK and Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 Vlautin formed The Delines with singer Amy Boone (The Damnations) and released their first album, Colfax. The band is on hiatus while Boone recovers from injuries sustained in a car accident.\r\n\r\nVlautin currently resides in Scappoose, Oregon.",

Add three distinct frontmen, a pension for sonic exploration and live performances that build to a fever pitch,and you've got a concoction that will make moonshiners proud and compel dancers to wear out the soles of their shoes.\r\n\r\nDMM released their sophomore album, Changing Lanes, in the fall of 2016 as a testament to the evolution of the group from a sideways folk outfit to a fully-recognized band pushing the borders of Americana. Boasting strong dynamics, bold songwriting and a rowdy live-energy feel, Changing Lanes is the work of a band who has heard the calling of the road and responded with song. Dodgy Mountain Men has toured from coast to coast, bringing their energetic sets to festivals including the John Hartford Memorial Festival (IN), Oak Harbor Festival (WA), Chinook Festival (WA),  Sawtooth Gathering (ID), Mystic Hot Springs Music Fest (UT), Love Your Mother Earth Festival (MT), Treefort Festival (ID), Red Ants Pants Festival and River City Roots (MT), to name a few. They have also had the pleasure of sharing more intimate stages with acts such as The Devil Makes Three, Greensky Bluegrass, The White Buffalo, Scott H. Biram, Jerry Joseph and the Jackmormons, Pert Near Sandstone, Toubab Krewe, Dead Winter Carpenters, Fruition, Brothers Comatose and countless others.",

        "bio": "Tylor & The Train Robbers debut album \"Gravel\" is a perfect blend of gritty americana and outlaw honky tonk. This album has been described as honest, inviting and quintessentially western (Micheal Deeds - Idaho Statesman). Released in May of 2017, \"Gravel\" is a compilation of 10 original songs written by lead singer Tylor Ketchum. Tylor describes this album as a snapshot of the band just as you’d hear them at a live show. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the Train Robbers are on the road touring throughout the US and are working on recording their second studio album, due out in the summer of 2018. \r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Helix, Oregon, singer/songwriter Tylor Ketchum started playing music at an early age. Fueled by musical influences within his family, he formed The Bushman Brothers Band with his younger siblings and began performing at local venues and events. Determined to further his career, Tylor left home and headed to Idaho in search of a broader music scene. \r\n\r\nWhile establishing himself as a solo performer and becoming immersed in the Idaho music community, he decided to form the band that has evolved into Tylor and the Train Robbers. The name inspired by his late relative, the infamous, train-robbing, Black Jack Ketchum. \r\n\r\nTylor carefully selected musicians he knew would help him achieve the sound he was looking for. He called on his younger brother, Jason Bushman to join him in Idaho and continue their musical journey together. With Jason playing bass and singing backup vocals they created a core molded around sibling harmony. Helping hold down the rhythm fort is their dynamic drummer, Flip Perkins. Rounding out the band’s sound is Johnny “Shoes” Pisano who brings his signature tele tone to the stage. \r\n\r\nWith this strong line up in place, Tylor & the Train Robbers have created a unique blend of gritty americana and outlaw honky tonk that has struck a chord within Northwest music scene.",

Called everything from Freak-Folk to Prog-Pop, there's no way of knowing what an Aan set is going to sound like, but it's definitely going to be sprawling and playful.\r\nAan takes a lot of sonic chances, employing out-jazz chord structures, soaring falsetto and throbbing low end. It's like Yes and Why? and The Who all together. Whoa, is that even ok?\r\nAan's last LP \"Dada Distractions\" was a heady chug of desperation and mourning. Finding influence equally in Aphrodite's Child and Alice in Chains. Their new tunes slated for LP3 find the band in a much more bubbling soup of sound, with tracks vibing to an Odelay dirt pulse. This will be their most expansive release to date so catching them while their still putting the finishing touches on these new cuts could prove exciting, either watching them flail or seeing them take flight.",

He took his start as \"the guy who marketed DOOM and Quake\" for id Software to found four different publishing companies, two of which have been acquired by public companies and two that are still independent and very active (Devolver Digital and Good Shepherd Entertainment).  \r\n\r\nHis current vision that he is speaking to us about is his most ambitious project to date; to marry these two worlds, and to help create a completely new and unique model of schooling and community for these artists and engineers to live, learn, teach, and thrive in.  He believes that this diverse population of creative and technical geniuses, who all too often live and work in isolation, can be brought together to help solve many of the largest problems facing the world, starting with this creation of a living blueprint for the establishment of new, sustainable peer-teaching communities outside of urban environments, that will also serve as a showcase of various renewable energy technologies, as well as a unique international tourist destination.",

Formed in early 2015 by Jordan Twiggs and Michael Ross in an effort to revive some of the music that had been scrapped by an earlier music project. They quickly brought in Philip Shellabarger to fill out the three piece that exists today. While the initial influences included Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees, Bass Drum of Death, and other similar jangly garage and surf rock, the band has grown to incorporate heavier psychedelic aspects.\r\n\r\n\"Like all of the great rock and roll trios in history, Serpentfoot manage to create tunes that seem so much bigger and grander than what you would think just three people are capable of. Marrying heavy and probably drug induced aural kilos of psych-rock a la the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the artsy proto-punk sneer of bands like Television and the Sonics is already a recipe for beautiful disaster. Easily. But the ‘foot doesn’t stop there; they then decide to add heapin’ helpin’s of noodly 60’s era surf and garage rock into the cake they’re baking, turning the whole mess of a into a new album and band that is so damn good you’ll need the recipe.\" - Pulp Magazine",

She is also ½ of the local DJ/Producer duo Black Plague.\r\n\r\nSome of her music’s biggest influences come from the art in Japan, UK Garage and Night Bass, Dirtybird Records, American and European Dubstep and Trap, old school Jazz and Big Band, African tribal music, vocalist Corey Taylor and his band Slipknot, poets Lana Del Rey and Shakespeare, Shambhala Music Festival, her friends X&G, and some good old fashioned occult magick. \r\n\r\nShe studies music and poetry at Boise State University, and plays the instruments ukulele, piano, and is picking up bass guitar this year. She is currently in the studio writing music, singing and producing EDM, and compiling her own poetry book. Supporting local artists and the music scene continues to be one of her greatest purposes and joys.\r\n\r\nShe would like to leave you with two of her favorite quotes regarding her purpose in music:\r\n\r\n“Let us read, and let us dance; these two amusements will never do any harm to the world.” - Voltaire\r\n\r\n“We’re shamanic healers offering glimpses of enlightenment through music.” – Calvin Harris, What Would Diplo Do\r\n\r\nSautrah is very excited to play Treefort again and honored to play music for you.",

His style of comedy truly embodies the \"new south\".  \r\nA south yearning to be seen as more than camouflage  and racism, a generation of young Americans bucking the often archaic values and dogma they were raised on. His brand of humor fearlessly tackles subjects of racism, homophobia, greed, war, loss, death, divorce and the danger of ignorance in pop culture and music. One moment he's using a satirical uber conservative redneck character to illuminate the fallacies of the far right talking points. The next moment he cleverly dissects some of today's most absurd rap lyrics. Cash remains dynamic and unique from the time he steps on stage until he says goodnight. When he's not on stage, Cliff spends most of his time in nature. He's on a mission to see #everynationalpark and put a million miles on his Mercedes wagon that he essentially lives in #miIlionmilemercedes. In 6 short years Cash has racked up an impressive list of credits for a comic not living in a major market.",

She has a gift for holding a sacred space of transcendence, while guiding her students to a place of union between mind, body and soul. \r\n\r\nOver the last 5 years her devotion and excitement to exploring how environment, sensory input, and intention effects a shift in consciousness, has lead her to work beside some of the most gifted artists, musicians and creatives in the wellness movement; including Walter Yoga, for whom she is both a resident yoga instructor and event producer. Kate has taught at numerous yoga and music festivals throughout the Nation, blurring the lines between yoga, movement, meditation, visual engineering, and sound immersion.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to exploring her students internal environment, Kate is even more detail oriented. She has a warm, peaceful, and grounding presence that gently guides her students to a peak state of integrated body awareness, intelligent and thoughtful movement, and self realization. \r\nBesides holding a sacred space of mind-blowing-multidimensional-blissed-out-radical-transformation, Kate is a mom and a wife, who loves to dance and laugh, and never takes life too seriously. She started on her yoga journey after suffering through a sever hardship. Yoga was what helped Kate find love, peace, contentment and purpose for her life, it is her life's work to give that gift back to the world.\r\n\r\nWorkshop Descriptions: \r\nFriday, 1:45-2:45PM\r\nVinSaucin'\r\nMusic by James Calleo\r\nWe have all felt those moments of bliss and transcendence, where the world seems to stop, and all our existential weight disappears so we can feel content and present.

Along with the music of the self-titled first release and the second release Justice, MOD is ready to make you sweat!!\r\n\r\n(Our actual journey to reach the world got about as far as Portland)\r\n\r\nSince their formation in the spring of 1984 members Todd Dunnigan (keyboards), Thomas J. Keithly the II (guitar), Corey Stoutenburg (bass) and Pete Weaver (drums) have worked hard fine tuning their talents. 'The music is a group effort,' Tom says 'A lot of our lyrics in our originals relate to day-to-day situations.'\r\n\r\n(virtually none of our lyrics dealt with day-to-day situations)\r\n\r\n'The important thing is not to be just another human jukebox,' Todd said 'You've got to do something original if you want to make it last.'\r\n\r\n(In some strange twist of fate I have made a living for the past 18 years being a human jukebox)\r\n\r\nCynthia J. Kludt of Seattle's Rocket feels that 'without the emphasis on electronics the music is allowed to dominate. Such differences in musical content accentuate the band's versatility. The sound is now - hip music for hip times.'\r\n\r\n(Unfortuantely this came right before grunge took over the world by purposely playing unhip music)\r\n\r\nTodd and Pete have composed and performed music for television commercials, summer stock theater productions and the Idaho Shakespeare Festival, while Corey's exstensive musical experience includes playing trumpet with an Alaskan opera company. Tom, who fronts the band, has held a prominent position in a number of local bands. With the recent addition of Douglas P. Carnie (sound, lights, promo) the band is ready to branch out from it's Boise roots.\r\n\r\n(All the way to Portland)\r\n\r\n\"We have a unique sound, not too heavily musical or philisophical\" Corey says, \"It's fun music...it's a nice blend\"\r\n\r\n(probably could have gone with that quote and called it good)",

        "bio": "Butcher Brown is an up-to-the minute throwback to the great progressive jazz bands of the 60s and 70s. They are a hard-working band in an era where most groups are fleeting assemblages, together only long enough to record.  Their organic coherence emerges from long collaboration as a group of equals rather than a top-down, leader/sideman lineup. They are building their audience by any means necessary, combining a conventional, label-oriented approach with releasing “underground” tapes, disciplined rehearsal and engaging, adventurous performance. This musical maturity is surprising in such a youthful band. The players in Butcher Brown were all born after the mid-70s golden age of fusion. But their modern, hip-hop-inflected funk has rich echoes of Weather Report, Return to Forever, early Earth Wind and Fire and, perhaps, a pungent whiff of Zappa. Like those bands, Butcher Brown’s unified sound comes from the intertwined talents of the four members, each bringing something unique to the mix.",

The result is a collection of songs as straightforward, carefree, and fun in one moment as unexpected and precise the next, all while retaining the cohesion of Bull’s singular musical vision from its origins as a bedroom recording project.",

After years in academia researching and teaching subjects that elevated one or the other half of that equation (doctorate in exercise science, master’s degree in counseling psychology), she turned her attention to the study of yoga – a perfect nexus of both.\r\n\r\nDebbi studied with yoga masters to deepen her knowledge and hone her practice. Her alignment based, slow flow style evolved from early work with Rodney Yee, Richard Freeman and Shiva Rea. But the heart of her teaching comes from Erich Schiffmann, whose message of self-trust and the transformative power of yoga really resonated with her background.\r\n\r\nThrough more than 40 years of study and experience, including a decade as director of Shanti Yoga Teacher Training, Debbi found that the best approach to mind-body vitality is informed by both western science and the spirit of eastern yogic philosophy. Whether you’re attending her popular local classes, national conferences, or international retreats you can expect an artful blend of sound science, ancient wisdom, and mind-body-spirit integration woven together in the beautiful, juicy flow of the vinyasa tradition.\r\n\r\nWorkshop:\r\nFriday, 10:45-11:45AM\r\nJourney to the Center\r\nMusic By Dave Stringer, Sheela Bringi, Brent Kuecker, and Qais Essar\r\nHere we dive deep into our center with attention to what supports us body, mind and spirit. Through a practice of power meridian strengthening, playful balance flow and core value awareness, we ignite our inner axis and emerge to stand strong, centered and authentic.\r\n",

        "bio": "Helvetia is a project that morphed out of the remains of the late 90’s band Duster. Jason Albertini and Dove Amber started performing the songs Jason was recording after moving to Seattle WA from San Jose Ca. This culminated with the first album “ The Clever North Wind “ being released by Duster braintrust, Clay Parton’s Static Cult Label along with Up records helping out with most aspects of an official release. They toured with Built To Spill and 10 Helvetia Albums in 10 years later Jason improbably joined BTS as the new bass player guy. He at that time hooked up helvetia with Joyful Noise Recordings and has released Nothing in Rambling (2012) and Dromomania (2015)  and am e.p ( Sun Chaser, 2017) with these lovely Indiana folks. \r\n\r\nThe name Helvetia was a nod at Jasons Swiss roots, having grown up next to Basel until heading for CA when he was 12. (With his mom and sister, not by himself.) every 1,2 and 5 frank coin bears the image of Helvetia, the female embodiment of the Swiss) It’s free associative, cut and paste, odd pop music that has been recorded all mostly by J. He has had lots of help along the way. \r\n\r\nThe band currently is Sam Stidham on bass, Katherine Paul ( Black Belt Eagle Scout ) on drums. Zeke Howard will be playing drums from time to time as his schedule permits, for the double drum bonanza that recreates a lot of the early recordings that where recorded with Jason and dove both playing the same beat into a 4 track ( old new bicycle, everything on the headless machine of the heart album). Jim Roth, long time friend and musical companion plays guitar along with Jason. Jason, Sam and Katherine sing. Anyways, 15 years after helvetia began, Jason is working on the final album called “28 songs and 3$ Tears” being released sometime late 2018. It will be their best record so far, no doubt. And we will keep playing shows because it’s fun. But if there are any other records it will be called HellAwaitsYa. Because Helvetia is a crappy band name, turns out. Xoxoxo",

        "bio": "Wild Ones delve into the bliss and burden that musicians are tasked with today: create work that captures your spirit, but do it without selling your soul. Self-produced and recorded, they walk the line of DIY oddity and polished pop sheen. Hailing from Portland, Oregon, the band combines the talents of lead vocalist Danielle Sullivan, keyboardist Thomas Himes, drummer Seve Sheldon, guitarist Nick Vicario and bassist Max Stein. Growing up on Cocteau Twins and En Vogue, their sound is a mash of R&B synths, muted guitar, and somber vocal melodies. After 7 years together, they've hit their stride in creating work that poses questions about art and authenticity.\r\n\r\nMirror Touch, the band’s latest record releasing in October 2017 via Topshelf Records, explores spaces of isolation, loneliness and how it feels when the line between self and other becomes blurred. The record title refers to the condition \"Mirror Touch Synesthesia\" and the physiological experience of empathy. How can you know yourself, when in public you become everyone else? The songs explore the quest to maintain artistic self-integrity in an industry that seeks to homogenize. Solitary in their process of collaboration, Himes and Vicario produce the music, while Sullivan crafts lyrics and melodies, their attempt at self-preservation against the ever-changing expectations of what music should or should not be. Combining their style of upbeat melodies with a backdrop of darker lyrical themes, an inquiry into their artistic process ultimately reflects a balance between earnest head nods to their favorite sounds with a fierce loyalty to their own sense of self.",

The music is a blend of groove, indie, electronic, and classic rock.  You might like it.  You might not.",

What started as a solo recording bedroom band (with Will playing all instruments and singing) eventually morphed into a full crew with the addition of drummer Justin Arroues, bassist Jake Lutz, and guitarist/vocalist Patrick Misner in the spring of 2016. Fixated on interstellar travel, their lyrics tend to use this motif to explore the perils of human relationships, but they also delve into more down-to-earth subjects. Like butts. The band recorded a 9-song album in the late summer of 2017 and are working to release it in the near future. In their last year of performing they’ve shared local stages with such acts as Amigo the Devil, Peelander-Z, Strawberry Girls, and The Fall of Troy.",

Laura's passion stems from an unfortunate and tragic experience in her life where she lost her mother to gun violence at the hands of her father. She seeks to uplift silenced voices by using her own to shine light on issues like domestic violence, gun violence and the intersecting adversities that come from these social issues. Her motivation and insight is seen and heard wherever she goes, and she hopes to begin a legacy in the name of her mother and other women who have been victims of these forms of violence. Laura aspires to become an attorney that challenges the current systems put in place that are supposed to protect and serve and she hopes to one day be able to create the change the state of Idaho needs to see.",

        "bio": "CMMNWLTH started in the Spring of 2017 when Joe Calvi moved to Boise, ID, and recorded the six-song Commonwealth EP as a DIY solo-project, which was completely crowd-funded. Shortly after the release of the Kickstarter-backed EP, Joe's cousin Patrick - just 18 and only recently picking up the drums - suggested that he could be a good fit for the project. Following, the newly-formed two-piece played as many shows as they could in the valley. Garnering attention amongst peers, friends, and strangers alike, the two felt the impending need to round out their sound and push their creative limits, leading to the addition of husband and wife Nik and Kristen Verlennich. The final combination of the four has resulted in an original mix of lyrically-driven pop-punk bangers and ballads riddled with unexpected dissonance and bouts of noise rock. CMMNWLTH has played shows alongside Southern California's Iris Jupiter, Portland's Snow Roller, and Columbus's Saintseneca.",

        "bio": "In July of 2005, the rock band Titus Andronicus made their first live appearance, performing for a few friends in an unfinished basement. The ensuing decade would see nearly 800 shows, 18 members, and the release of three full-length albums and 14 7-inches, as the group rose from their obscure beginnings in the tri-state DIY scene to the heights of international “indie stardom,” only to (nearly?) throw it all away in a vicious cycle of depression and decadence. The culmination of that ten-year journey is \"The Most Lamentable Tragedy\", the fourth studio album by Titus Andronicus. and the band’s debut for Merge Records. \"TMLT\" is the pinnacle and the missing piece, both the crown jewel of the band’s discography and the legend that contextualizes their entire body of work. It reveals that Titus Andronicus are what hardcore fans have said they are for years, and what the world must now recognize them to be: not merely the greatest rock and roll band of this era, but one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.",

        "bio": "Smokey Brights make music that taps into history and stretches out a kind of visionary rock that rolls relentlessly forward while recombining iconic sounds - from funk to Fleetwood Mac, Bowie to Blur, disco to Dire Straits, and splashes of Floyd psychedelia - crafting something urgent, fun, and utterly surprising. The band’s driving rhythms, lusciously tight harmonies, and swirling guitar lines lay down a sumptuous, expansive 70s landscape that invites the listener to lay back, turn up, and dive deep into the depths of inner space.  \r\n\r\nSmokey Brights are fronted by husband and wife songwriting duo Ryan Devlin (guitar, vocals) and Kim West (keys, vocals). Their North Seattle home, crammed full of thrift shop treasures and instruments, is a constant bustle of songwriting, demos, BBQs, and band practice. Song ideas are shared over coffee, sketched into notebooks strewn throughout their home, and flushed out on guitar, piano, and voice before making their way downstairs to the band’s wood-paneled practice room.\r\n\r\nSmokey Brights’ rhythmic bedrock is laid down by the mind-melding duo of Jim Vermillion (bass) and Nick Krivchenia (drums). Best friends and brothers in rhythm for over ten years, their sonic connection is the palpable pulse that runs through the signature, Smokeys sound.\r\n\r\nFloating deftly above this rock foundation are the unpredictable and experimental lines of guitar hero Mike Kalnoky (guitar). Pulling from a seemingly endless bag of six-string tricks, Kalnoky brings a level of experimentation to the world of Smokey Brights that makes the music both deeper and stranger, but never at the expense of song integrity.\r\n\r\nIn the six years Smokey Brights have played together, they've come to focus on the familiar and the bizarre - the spaces where the light just starts to shine through the darkness. Their music evokes that feeling of discovering a dusty record in your parents’ attic that somehow sounds new, made just for the moment you are in. Delighting in the experimentation of groove and sound, but always building upon a sturdy framework of song, Smokey Brights creates what, at times, seems lost in modern music: real songs with real meanings that elicit real feelings.",

The outcome of those sessions is Honyock’s forthcoming debut L.P., entitled \"El Castillo\", out on Friendship Fever early 2018.",

        "bio": "Swatkins is a joyful prophet of positivity. Together with his band, The Positive Agenda, he plays feel-good funk made by and for real human beings. Steve Swatkins is part of the new generation of performers making raw, fresh soulful music without relying on computers or backing tracks. This multi-instrumentalist is a master of the talkbox, an old-school analog effect using his larynx to shape the sound of his keyboard synthesizer sent through a vinyl tube. Think of the funky robot voice from \"California Love\" or the hair-raising harmony intro to \"24 Karat Magic.\" Now picture a throwback dance party with a killer live band playing the deepest grooves imaginable, and you've got a taste of what The Positive Agenda is all about.  \r\n\r\nSwatkins has long been a fixture on the touring scene in his capacity as a sideman and guest artist. As a fulltime member of Excellent Gentlemen and Juno What?! he's spread his irresistible signature style on stages across the US and Canada. Since joining Allen Stone's band in 2013, he's been around the world several times, becoming an indispensable part of the live show and co-writing several of Allen's songs, including the lead single \"Upside\" from Stone's latest album, Radius. Most recently, he's guest-starred with Brooklyn's Turkuaz at their debut Red Rocks performance, sat in with Vulfpeck at their biggest NYC show to date in Central Park, and has toured subbing on keyboards with modern funk legends Lettuce. Now with Steve's new original project, The Positive Agenda, his dedicated fans can see the Swatkins they know and love in a brand new setting, bringing high-energy performances to dancefloors everywhere.",

        "bio": "Grammy-nominated guitarist and producer Christopher Willits occupies a unique corner of the music universe -- hovering above the intersection of electronic production's nuts and bolts and a wide-open creative mind. His tireless activity has produced over 25 albums in the last 15 years -- solo and in collaboration with artists including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Tycho, and Taylor Deupree -- and an organic, minimal sound that expands like the vines of an electro-acoustic kudzu plant. Willits is the co-founder of spatial audio / 3D sound platform Envelop as well as the creative collective Overlap, a teacher of music and mediation in San Francisco, a tech geek, a visual/new media artist, and virtuosic musician in one. Throughout, he strives to create space in which to illuminate creativity and catalyze inner change.\r\n\r\nIn Willits' music, all elements are interconnected; voice and guitar lines fold into bleary, unrecognizable shapes and polyrhythmic textures, often overlapping with his own cinematic film and video work. This widescreen approach grows more immersive and innovative with each release. A full list of his critically acclaimed catalog would take up considerable column space, but a beginner's guide to Willits includes 2002's Folding, and the Tea (his debut on 12k), 2006's landmark Surf Boundaries (his first full-length on Ghostly International), 2008's Ocean Fire (Willits' collaboration with renowned pianist / composer Ryuichi Sakamoto), 2010's Tiger Flower Circle Sun (a study on universal vibrations), 2012's Ancient Future (his second album with Sakamoto), and the audiovisual LP Opening recorded with the whole band of Tycho in 2014.",

        "bio": "LA based rapper, Henry Canyons, transcends your typical boundaries of hip-hop identity. The half-French, Brooklyn native draws from his diverse cultural background which directly reflects on his musical style.  On his first album Canyonland, Henry and Paris’ Keor Meteor teamed up on a jazzy, boom bap-centric and introspective record guaranteed to leave listeners quenched with a refreshing cocktail of soulful hip-hop. In 2016, Berlin based Jakarta Records re-released Canylonland on limited edition vinyl that sold out in a matter of hours.  In September of 2016, Canyons participated in a two month artist residency at BoiSakré Productions in Biarritz, France which resulted in La Côte West EP inspired by his experience in Europe.  La Côte West, released on January 1, 2018 on Brooklyn-based label Backwoodz Studioz, and recently made Bandcamp's Best Hip-Hop of January 2018 list. \r\n\r\n On stage, it is Henry’s electric energy, command over the crowd, and ability to control his SP 404 while simultaneously rapping that proves that he is a one man spectacle. Over the course of his career Canyons has shared the stage with Macklemore, Tash (Tha Alkaholiks), Open Mike Eagle, Homeboy Sandman, Pigeon Jon, Blue Scholars, Billy Woods, Illogic, and tons of local LA talent.",

IT EVOKED THE SCALE OF POST ROCK EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS THE BOREDOMS' 77 AND 88 BOADRUM EVENT GATHERINGS, BUT ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING MORE JOYOUS AND PROFOUND: A CONVERSATION, NOT JUST A SHARED TRANCE. IT WAS EPIC. IT WAS EXHILARATING. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.“ - OREGON LIVE \r\n\r\nBand Dialogue is a massive composition, experiment, and conversation that explores the sonics of many bands, stretched out across a space, playing simultaneously, part orchestra, part installation. Continuing in the lineage of large scale guitar and drum events by the likes of NYC composer Rhys Chatham and Osaka noise lords Boredoms, each version is adapted to the site and bands for something totally unique - bands radiate their individual glory while simultaneously expanding into one colossal sound. \r\n\r\nBand Dialogue is a piece I started imagining in 2012 and composed the first version of in 2013 for Hopscotch Music Festival with the production help of Martin Anderson and Tina Haver Currin helping me pull off the crazy idea the first time. Since then I have been lucky to do it at Treefort Music Fest and Sled Island as well as Hopscotch, which I think are 3 of the coolest music festivals in North America right now. All with their own individual, artistic voice, but sharing a focus on music and community which for me is what Band Dialogue is all about. Every year the piece keeps getting different, bigger, and LOUDER and I've met an amazing amount of incredible musicians, discovered new bands, and made new friends. \r\n\r\n“FOR MANY, THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE FESTIVAL CAME ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AT BAND DIALOGUE III, WHERE SETH OLINSKY OF AKRON/FAMILY, WHO WAS PERFORMING AT TREEFORT UNDER THE MONIKER OF HIS SIDE-PROJECT CY DUNE, TOOK ON THE ROLE OF COMPOSER AND CONDUCTOR IN LEADING A DOZEN FULL BANDS IN A MASSIVE ORCHESTRA THAT LINED BOTH SIDES OF A CLOSED OFF CITY BLOCK. OLINSKY USED CUE CARDS TO GIVE THE BANDS CHORD PROGRESSIONS, AND HIS BACK AND FORTH COMMANDS TRIGGERED BANDS, INSTRUMENTS, AND ALTERNATING SIDES OF THE STREET, CREATING A SWEEPING WHIRLWIND OF SOUND THAT WASHED OVER EVERYTHING IN THE SURROUNDING AREA.“ - PORTLAND MERCURY \r\n\r\n\r\nMUSICIANS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN BAND DIALOGUE I - VI include: \r\n\r\nDelicate Steve, Disco Doom, Sun Blood Stories, The Western Mystics, Cy Dune, Ali Beletic, Dana Buoy, Tuft, Animal Eyes, Invisible Hand, Religious Girls, AU, AAN, Built to Spill, American Culture, Marshall Poole, C.J.

Emma once followed a eulogy at the Limestone Comedy Festival, after which, Bobcat Goldthwait told her he’d never seen anyone do what she does. In addition to being a successful touring comedian, Emma is a third generation beekeeper and honey farmer. She is the cofounder and artistic director of the 208 Comedyfest, as well as the codirector of Comedyfort (part of the Treefort Festival), and her debut comedy album, \"Shut Up, Calvin\" is available from Rooftop Comedy. When not touring, Emma lives in Idaho, where she keeps kids and bees with varying degrees of success.",
